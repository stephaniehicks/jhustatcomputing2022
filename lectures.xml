<h1>Overview and history of R</h1>
<p>Below is a very quick introduction to R, to get you set up and running. We’ll go deeper into R and coding later.</p>
<section id="tldr-r-in-a-nutshell" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr-r-in-a-nutshell">tl;dr (R in a nutshell)</h3>
<p>Like every programming language, R has its advantages and disadvantages. If you search the internet, you will quickly discover lots of folks with opinions about R. Some of the features that are useful to know are:</p>
<ul>
<li>R is open-source, freely accessible, and cross-platform (multiple OS).</li>
<li>R is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">“high-level” programming language</a>, relatively easy to learn.
<ul>
<li>While “Low-level” programming languages (e.g.&nbsp;Fortran, C, etc) often have more efficient code, they can also be harder to learn because it is designed to be close to a machine language.</li>
<li>In contrast, high-level languages deal more with variables, objects, functions, loops, and other abstract CS concepts with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>R is great for statistics, data analysis, websites, web apps, data visualizations, and so much more!</li>
<li>R integrates easily with document preparation systems like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLaTeX">, but R files can also be used to create <code>.docx</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.html</code>, <code>.ppt</code> files with integrated R code output and graphics.</li>
<li>The R Community is very dynamic, helpful and welcoming.
<ul>
<li>Check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats">#rstats</a> on Twitter, <a href="https://www.tidytuesday.com">TidyTuesday</a> podcast and community activity in the <a href="https://www.rfordatasci.com">R4DS Online Learning Community</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/">r/rstats</a> subreddit.</li>
<li>If you are looking for more local resources, check out <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-baltimore/">R-Ladies Baltimore</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Through R packages, it is easy to get lots of state-of-the-art algorithms.</li>
<li>Documentation and help files for R are generally good.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we use R in this course, it is not the only option to analyze data. Maybe the most similar to R, and widely used, is Python, which is also free. There is also commercial software that can be used to analyze data (e.g., Matlab, Mathematica, Tableau, SAS, SPSS). Other more general programming languages are suitable for certain types of analyses as well (e.g., C, Fortran, Perl, Java, Julia).</p>
<p>Depending on your future needs or jobs, you might have to learn one or several of those additional languages. The good news is that even though those languages are all different, they all share general ways of thinking and structuring code. So once you understand a specific concept (e.g., variables, loops, branching statements or functions), it applies to all those languages. Thus, learning a new programming language is much easier once you already know one. And R is a good one to get started with.</p>
<p>With the skills gained in this course, hopefully you will find R a fun and useful programming langauge for your future projects.</p>

<section id="basic-features-of-r" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-features-of-r">Basic Features of R</h3>
<p>Today R runs on almost any standard computing platform and operating system. Its open source nature means that anyone is free to adapt the software to whatever platform they choose. Indeed, R has been reported to be running on modern tablets, phones, PDAs, and game consoles.</p>
<p>One nice feature that R shares with many popular open source projects is frequent releases. These days there is a major annual release, typically in October, where major new features are incorporated and released to the public. Throughout the year, smaller-scale bugfix releases will be made as needed. The frequent releases and regular release cycle indicates active development of the software and ensures that bugs will be addressed in a timely manner. Of course, while the core developers control the primary source tree for R, many people around the world make contributions in the form of new feature, bug fixes, or both.</p>
<p>Another key advantage that R has over many other statistical packages (even today) is its sophisticated graphics capabilities. R’s ability to create “publication quality” graphics has existed since the very beginning and has generally been better than competing packages. Today, with many more visualization packages available than before, that trend continues. R’s base graphics system allows for very fine control over essentially every aspect of a plot or graph. Other newer graphics systems, like lattice and ggplot2 allow for complex and sophisticated visualizations of high-dimensional data.</p>
<p>R has maintained the original S philosophy (see box below), which is that <strong>it provides a language that is both useful for interactive work, but contains a powerful programming language for developing new tools</strong>. This allows the user, who takes existing tools and applies them to data, to slowly but surely become a developer who is creating new tools.</p>

<p>For a great discussion on an overview and history of R and the S programming language, read through <a href="https://rdpeng.github.io/Biostat776/lecture-introduction-and-overview.html">this chapter</a> from Roger D. Peng.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, one of the joys of using R has nothing to do with the language itself, but rather with the active and vibrant user community. In many ways, a language is successful inasmuch as it creates a platform with which many people can create new things. R is that platform and thousands of people around the world have come together to make contributions to R, to develop packages, and help each other use R for all kinds of applications. The R-help and R-devel mailing lists have been highly active for over a decade now and there is considerable activity on web sites like Stack Overflow, Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats">#rstats</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rtistry">#rtistry</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/">Reddit</a>.</p>

<section id="free-software" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="free-software">Free Software</h3>
<p>A major advantage that R has over many other statistical packages and is that it’s free in the sense of free software (it’s also free in the sense of free beer). The copyright for the primary source code for R is held by the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/foundation/">R Foundation</a> and is published under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU General Public License version 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Free Software Foundation, with <em>free software</em>, you are granted the following <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four freedoms</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).</p></li>
<li><p>The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p></li>
<li><p>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</p></li>
<li><p>The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p></li>

<section id="design-of-the-r-system" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="design-of-the-r-system">Design of the R System</h3>
<p>The primary R system is available from the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">Comprehensive R Archive Network</a>, also known as CRAN. CRAN also hosts many add-on packages that can be used to extend the functionality of R.</p>
<p>The R system is divided into 2 conceptual parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The “base” R system that you download from CRAN:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/">Linux</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">Mac</a></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Everything else.</li>
</ol>
<p>R functionality is divided into a number of <em>packages</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The “base” R system contains, among other things, the <code>base</code> package which is required to run R and contains the most fundamental functions.</p></li>
<li><p>The other packages contained in the “base” system include <code>utils</code>, <code>stats</code>, <code>datasets</code>, <code>graphics</code>, <code>grDevices</code>, <code>grid</code>, <code>methods</code>, <code>tools</code>, <code>parallel</code>, <code>compiler</code>, <code>splines</code>, <code>tcltk</code>, <code>stats4</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also “Recommended” packages: <code>boot</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>cluster</code>, <code>codetools</code>, <code>foreign</code>, <code>KernSmooth</code>, <code>lattice</code>, <code>mgcv</code>, <code>nlme</code>, <code>rpart</code>, <code>survival</code>, <code>MASS</code>, <code>spatial</code>, <code>nnet</code>, <code>Matrix</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you download a fresh installation of R from CRAN, you get all of the above, which represents a substantial amount of functionality. However, there are many other packages available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are over 10,000 packages on CRAN that have been developed by users and programmers around the world.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also many packages associated with the <a href="http://bioconductor.org">Bioconductor project</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>People often make packages available on their personal websites; there is no reliable way to keep track of how many packages are available in this fashion.</p></li>

<section id="limitations-of-r" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-of-r">Limitations of R</h3>
<p>No programming language or statistical analysis system is perfect. R certainly has a number of drawbacks. For starters, R is essentially based on almost 50 year old technology, going back to the original S system developed at Bell Labs. There was originally little built in support for dynamic or 3-D graphics (but things have improved greatly since the “old days”).</p>
<p>Another commonly cited limitation of R is that objects must generally be stored in physical memory (though this is increasingly not true anymore). This is in part due to the scoping rules of the language, but R generally is more of a memory hog than other statistical packages. However, there have been a number of advancements to deal with this, both in the R core and also in a number of packages developed by contributors. Also, computing power and capacity has continued to grow over time and amount of physical memory that can be installed on even a consumer-level laptop is substantial. While we will likely never have enough physical memory on a computer to handle the increasingly large datasets that are being generated, the situation has gotten quite a bit easier over time.</p>
<p>At a higher level one “limitation” of R is that its functionality is based on consumer demand and (voluntary) user contributions. If no one feels like implementing your favorite method, then it’s <em>your</em> job to implement it (or you need to pay someone to do it). The capabilities of the R system generally reflect the interests of the R user community. As the community has ballooned in size over the past 10 years, the capabilities have similarly increased. When I first started using R, there was very little in the way of functionality for the physical sciences (physics, astronomy, etc.). However, now some of those communities have adopted R and we are seeing more code being written for those kinds of applications.</p>

<h1>Using R and RStudio</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If R is the engine and bare bones of your car, then RStudio is like the rest of the car. The engine is super critical part of your car. But in order to make things properly functional, you need to have a steering wheel, comfy seats, a radio, rear and side view mirrors, storage, and seatbelts. — <em>Nicholas Tierney</em></p>

<p>The RStudio layout has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the upper left, something called a Rmarkdown script</li>
<li>On the lower left, the R console</li>
<li>On the lower right, the view for files, plots, packages, help, and viewer.</li>

<p>The file/plot/pkg viewer is a handy browser for your current files, like Finder, or File Explorer, plots are where your plots appear, you can view packages, see the help files. And the environment / history pane contains the list of things you have created, and the past commands that you have run.</p>

<li>If you have not already, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">install R first</a>. If you already have R installed, make sure it is a fairly recent version, version 4.0 or newer. If yours is older, I suggest you update (install a new R version).</li>
<li>Once you have R installed, install the free version of <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">RStudio Desktop</a>. Again, make sure it’s a recent version.</li>

</section>
<section id="rstudio-default-options" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rstudio-default-options">RStudio default options</h3>
<p>To first get set up, I highly recommend changing the following setting</p>
<p>Tools &gt; Global Options (or <code>Cmd + ,</code> on macOS)</p>
<p>Under the <strong>General</strong> tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>workspace</strong>
<ul>
<li>Uncheck restore .RData into workspace at startup</li>
<li>Save workspace to .RData on exit : “Never”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For <strong>History</strong>
<ul>
<li>Uncheck “Always save history (even when not saving .RData)</li>
<li>Uncheck “Remove duplicate entries in history”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that you won’t save the objects and other things that you create in your R session and reload them. This is important for two reasons</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>: you don’t want to have objects from last week cluttering your session</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong>: you don’t want to save private data or other things to your session. You only want to read these in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your “history” is the commands that you have entered into R.</p>
<p>Additionally, not saving your history means that you won’t be relying on things that you typed in the last session, which is a good habit to get into!</p>
</section>
<section id="installing-and-loading-r-packages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-and-loading-r-packages">Installing and loading R packages</h3>
<p>As we discussed, most of the functionality and features in R come in the form of add-on packages. There are tens of thousands of packages available, some big, some small, some well documented, some not. We will be using many different packages in this course. Of course, you are free to install and use any package you come across for any of the assignments.</p>
<p>The “official” place for packages is the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">CRAN website</a>. If you are interested in packages on a specific topic, the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/">CRAN task views</a> provide curated descriptions of packages sorted by topic.</p>
<p>To install an R package from CRAN, one can simply call the <code>install.packages()</code> function and pass the name of the package as an argument. For example, to install the <code>ggplot2</code> package from CRAN: open RStudio,go to the R prompt (the <code>&gt;</code> symbol) in the lower-left corner and type</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">install.packages</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"ggplot2"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>and the appropriate version of the package will be installed.</p>
<p>Often, a package needs other packages to work (called dependencies), and they are installed automatically. It usually does not matter if you use a single or double quotation mark around the name of the package.</p>
<div class="callout-important callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">

<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">
Important
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As you installed the <code>ggplot2</code> package, what other packages were installed?</li>
<li>What happens if you tried to install <code>GGplot2</code>?</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>It could be that you already have all packages required by <code>ggplot2</code> installed. In that case, you will not see any other packages installed. To see which of the packages above <code>ggplot2</code> needs (and thus installs if it is not present), type into the R console:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1">tools<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">package_dependencies</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"ggplot2"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>In RStudio, you can also install (and update/remove) packages by clicking on the ‘Packages’ tab in the bottom right window.</p>
<p>It is very common these days for packages to be developed on GitHub. It is possible to install packages from GitHub directly. Those usually contain the latest version of the package, with features that might not be available yet on the CRAN website. Sometimes, in early development stages, a package is only on GitHub until the developer(s) feel it is good enough for CRAN submission. So installing from GitHub gives you the latest. The downside is that packages under development can often be buggy and not working right. To install packages from GitHub, you need to install the <code>remotes</code> package and then use the following function</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1">remotes<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">install_github</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>We will not do that now, but it is quite likely that at one point later in this course we will.</p>
<p>You only need to install a package once, unless you upgrade/re-install R. Once installed, you still need to load the package before you can use it. That has to happen every time you start a new R session. You do that using the <code>library()</code> command. For instance to load the <code>ggplot2</code> package, type</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'ggplot2'</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>You may or may not see a short message on the screen. Some packages show messages when you load them, and others do not.</p>
<p>This was a quick overview of R packages. We will use a lot of them, so you will get used to them rather quickly.</p>

<p>While one can use R and do pretty much every task, including all the ones we cover in this class, without using RStudio, RStudio is very useful, has lots of features that make your R coding life easier and has become pretty much the default integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Since RStudio has lots of features, it takes time to learn them. A good resource to learn more about RStudio are the <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/">R Studio Essentials</a> collection of videos.</p>

<p>Welcome! I am very excited to have you in our one-term (i.e.&nbsp;half a semester) course on Statistical Computing course number (140.776) offered by the <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics">Department of Biostatistics</a> at the <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</a>.</p>
<p>This course is designed for ScM and PhD students at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I am pretty flexible about permitting outside students, but I want everyone to be aware of the goals and assumptions so no one feels like they are surprised by how the class works.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The primary goal of the course is to teach you practical programming and computational skills required for the research and application of statistical methods.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This class is not designed to teach the theoretical aspects of statistical or computational methods, but rather the goal is to help with the <strong>practical issues</strong> related to setting up a statistical computing environment for data analyses, developing high-quality R packages, conducting reproducible data analyses, best practices for data visualization and writing code, and creating websites for personal or project use.</p>
<section id="assumptions-and-pre-requisites" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assumptions-and-pre-requisites">Assumptions and pre-requisites</h3>
<p>The course is designed for students in the Johns Hopkins Biostatistics Masters and PhD programs. However, we do not assume a significant background in statistics. Specifically we assume:</p>
<section id="you-know-the-basics-of-at-least-one-programming-language-e.g.-r-or-python" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="you-know-the-basics-of-at-least-one-programming-language-e.g.-r-or-python">1. You know the basics of at least one programming language (e.g.&nbsp;R or Python)</h4>
<ul>
<li>If it’s not R, we assume that you are willing to spend the time to learn R</li>
<li>You have heard of things such as control structures, functions, loops, etc</li>
<li>Know the difference between different data types (e.g.&nbsp;character, numeric, etc)</li>
<li>Know the basics of plotting (e.g.&nbsp;what is a scatterplot, histogram, etc)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="you-know-the-basics-of-computing-environments" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="you-know-the-basics-of-computing-environments">2. You know the <strong>basics</strong> of computing environments</h4>
<ul>
<li>You have access to a computing environment (i.e.&nbsp;locally on a laptop or working in the cloud)</li>
<li>You generally feel comfortable with installing and working with software</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="you-know-the-basics-of-statistics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="you-know-the-basics-of-statistics">3. You know the <strong>basics</strong> of statistics</h4>
<ul>
<li>The central dogma (estimates, standard errors, basic distributions, etc.)</li>
<li>Key statistical terms and methods</li>
<li>Differences between estimation vs testing vs prediction</li>
<li>Know how to fit and interpret <strong>basic</strong> statistical models (e.g.&nbsp;linear models)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="you-know-the-basics-of-reproducible-research" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="you-know-the-basics-of-reproducible-research">4. You know the <strong>basics</strong> of reproducible research</h4>
<ul>
<li>Difference between replication and reproducible</li>
<li>Know how to cite references (e.g.&nbsp;like in a publication)</li>
<li>Somewhat familiar with tools that enable reproducible research (In complete transparency, we will briefly cover these topics in the first week, but depending on your comfort level with them, this may impact whether you choose to continue with the course).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the target audience for this course is advanced students in statistics we will not be able to spend significant time covering these concepts and technologies. To give you some idea about how these prerequisites will impact your experience in the course, we will be turning in all assignments via R Markdown documents and you will be encouraged (not required) to use git/GitHub to track changes to your code over time. The majority of the assignments will involve learning the practical issues around performing data analyses, building software packages, building websites, etc all using the R programming language. Data analyses you will perform will also often involve significant data extraction, cleaning, and transformation. We will learn about tools to do all of this, but hopefully most of this sounds familiar to you so you can focus on the concepts we will be teaching around best practices for statistical computing.</p>

<p>You must install <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">R</a> and <a href="https://rstudio.com">RStudio</a> on your computing environment in order to complete this course. These are two <strong>different</strong> applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>R is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course</p></li>
<li><p>RStudio is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both R and RStudio are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux. Please download the version that is suitable for your computing setup.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, we will make use of numerous R add-on packages that must be installed over the Internet. Packages can be installed using the <code>install.packages()</code> function in R. For example, to install the <code>tidyverse</code> package, you can run</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">install.packages</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"tidyverse"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>My research focuses on developing fast, scalable, statistical methodology and open-source software for genomics and biomedical data analysis for human health and disease. My research is <strong>problem-forward</strong>: I develop statistical methods and software that are motivated by concrete problems, often with real-world, noisy, messy data. I’m also interested in developing theory for how to incorporate <em>design thinking</em> (alongside <em>statistical thinking</em>) in practice of data analysis.</p>
<p>If you want, you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/stephaniehicks">Twitter</a>. I’m also a co-host of the <a href="https://twitter.com/CorrespondAuth">The Corresponding Author</a> podcast, member of the <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board">Editorial Board for <em>Genome Biology</em></a>, an Associate Editor for <a href="https://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide/">Reproducibility</a> at the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/uasa20/current">Journal of the American Statistical Association</a>, and co-founder of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-baltimore/">R-Ladies Baltimore</a>.</p>

<p>It is super tough to be dealing with the pandemic, an economic crisis, challenges with visas and travel and coordinating school online. As your instructor, I understand that this is not an ordinary year. I am <em>ultra</em> sympathetic to family challenges and life challenges. I have three small children (who may make cameos in lectures from time to time).</p>
<p>My goal is to make as much of the class asynchronous as possible so you can work whenever you have time. My plan is to be as understanding as possible when it comes to grading, and any issues that come up with the course. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me (or the TAs) if you are having issues and we will do our best to direct you to whatever resources we have/accommodate you however we can.</p>
<p>I think the material in this course is important, fun, and this is an opportunity to learn a lot. But life is more important than a course and if there was ever a time that life might get in the way of learning, it’s likely now.</p>

<p>We believe the purpose of graduate education is to train you to be able to think for yourself and initiate and complete your own projects. We are super excited to talk to you about ideas, work out solutions with you, and help you to figure out how to produce professional data analyses. We do not think that graduate school grades are important for this purpose. This means that we do not care very much about graduate student grades.</p>
<p>That being said, we have to give you a grade so they will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A - Excellent - 90%+</li>
<li>B - Passing - 80%+</li>
<li>C - Needs improvement - 70%+</li>
</ul>
<p>We rarely give out grades below a C and if you consistently submit work, and do your best you are very likely to get an A or a B in the course.</p>
</section>
<section id="relative-weights" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relative-weights">Relative weights</h4>
<p>The grades are based on three projects (plus one entirely optional project to help you get set up). The breakdown of grading will be</p>
<ul>
<li>33% for Project 1</li>
<li>33% for Project 2</li>
<li>34% for Project 3</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submit an project solution, it is your own work, and it meets a basic level of completeness and effort you will get 100% for that project. If you submit a project solution, but it doesn’t meet basic completeness and effort you will receive 50%. If you do not submit an solution you will receive 0%.</p>

<section id="submitting-assignments" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="submitting-assignments">Submitting assignments</h3>
<p>Please write up your project solutions using R Markdown. In some cases, you will compile a R Markdown file into an HTML file and submit your HTML file to the dropbox on Courseplus. In other cases, you may create an R package or website. In all of the above, when applicable, show all your code and provide as much explanation / documentation as you can.</p>
<p>For each project, we will provide a time when we download the materials. We will assume whatever version we download at that time is what you are turning in.</p>

<section id="reproducibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h3>
<p>We will talk about reproducibility a bit during class, and it will be a part of the homework assignments as well. Reproducibility of scientific code is very challenging, so the faculty and TAs completely understand difficulties that arise. But we think that it is important that you practice reproducible research. In particular, your project assignments should perform the tasks that you are asked to do and create the figures and tables you are asked to make as a part of the compilation of your document. We will have some pointers for some issues that have come up as we announce the projects.</p>

<section id="code-of-conduct" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of course participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any work event, including group meetings, conferences, talks, parties, Twitter and other online media. This code of conduct applies to all course participants, including instructors and TAs, and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, including GitHub project repos, Slack channels, and Twitter.</p>
<p>Course participants violating these rules will be referred to leadership of the Department of Biostatistics and the Title IX coordinator at JHU and may face expulsion from the class.</p>
<p>All class participants agree to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be considerate</strong> in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of other members.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful</strong>. Disagreements happen, but do not require poor behavior or poor manners. Frustration is inevitable, but it should never turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Course participants should be respectful both of the other course participants and those outside the course.</li>
<li><strong>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech</strong>. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert Stephanie Hicks.</li>
<li><strong>Take care of each other</strong>. Refrain from advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. And, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Alert Stephanie Hicks if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
</ul>

<section id="introduction-to-gitgithub" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction to git/GitHub</h1>
<p>This document gives a brief explanation of GitHub and how we will use it for this course.</p>
<section id="git" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="git">git</h3>
<p><em>Git</em> is what is called a <em>version control system</em> for file management. The main idea is that as you (and your collaborators) work on a project, the software tracks, and records any changes made by anyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the “track changes” features in Microsoft Word, but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files</li>
<li>Great for solo or collaborative work</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="github" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="github">GitHub</h3>
<p><em>GitHub</em> is a hosting service on internet for git-aware folders and projects</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the DropBox or Google, but more structured, powerful, and programmatic</li>
<li>Great for solo or collaborative work!</li>
<li>Technically <em>GitHub</em> is distinct from <em>Git</em>. However, <em>GitHub</em> is in some sense the interface and <em>Git</em> the underlying engine (a bit like <em>RStudio</em> and <em>R</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we will only be using <em>Git</em> through <em>GitHub</em>, I tend to not distinguish between the two. In the following, I refer to all of it as just <em>GitHub</em>. Note that other interfaces to <em>Git</em> exist, e.g., <em>Bitbucket</em>, but <em>GitHub</em> is the most widely used one.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-use-gitgithub" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-use-gitgithub">Why use git/GitHub?</h3>
<p>You want to use <em>GitHub</em> to avoid this:</p>

<p>[<a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1531">Source: PhD Comics</a>]</p>
<p><em>GitHub</em> gives you a clean way to track your projects. It is also very well suited to collaborative work. Historically, version control was used for software development. However, it has become broader and is now used for many types of projects, including data science projects.</p>
<p>To learn a bit more about Git/GitHub and why you might want to use it, <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/">read this article by Jenny Bryan</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note her explanation of what’s special with the <code>README.md</code> file on GitHub.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="what-to-not-do" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-to-not-do">What to (not) do</h3>
<p>GitHub is ideal if you have a project with a fair number of files, most of those files are text files (such as code, LaTeX, (R)markdown, etc.) and different people work on different parts of the project.</p>
<p>GitHub is less useful if you have a lot of non-text files (e.g.&nbsp;Word or Powerpoint) and different team members might want to edit the same document at the same time. In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+Onedrive, etc. might be better.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-use-gitgithub" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-use-gitgithub">How to use Git/GitHub</h3>
<p>Git and GitHub is fundamentally based on commands you type into the command line. Lots of online resources show you how to use the command line. This is the most powerful, and the way I almost always interact with git/GitHub. However, many folks find this the most confusing way to use git/GitHub. Alternatively, there are graphical interfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub itself</a> provides a grapical interface with basic functionality.</li>
<li>RStudio also has <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html">Git/GitHub integration</a>. Of course this only works for R project GitHub integration.</li>
<li>There are also third party GitHub clients with many advanced features, most of which you won’t need initially, but might eventually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As student, you can (and should) upgrade to the Pro version of GitHub for free (i.e.&nbsp;access to unlimited private repositories is one benefit), see the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub student developer pack</a> on how to do this.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="getting-started" class="level1">
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>One of my favorite resources for getting started with git/GitHub is the Happy Git with R from Jenny Bryan:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://happygitwithr.com</li>
</ul>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://github.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatcomputing2022/images/happygitwithr.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A screenshot of the Happy Git with R online book from Jenny Bryan</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It truly is one of the <strong>best resources</strong> out there for getting started with git/GitHub, especially with the integration to RStudio. Therefore, at this point, I will encourage all of you to go read through the online book.</p>
<p>Some of you may only need to skim it, others will need to spend some time reading through it. Either way, I will bet that you won’t regret the time investment.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-gitgithub-in-our-course" class="level1">
<h1>Using git/GitHub in our course</h1>
<p>In this course, you will use git/GitHub in the following ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Project 0 (optional) - You will create a website introducing yourself to folks in the course and deploy it on GitHub.</li>
<li>Projects 1-3 - You will be asked to practice using git locally (on your compute environment) to track your changes over time and, if you wish (but highly suggested), you can practice pushing your project solutions to a private GitHub repository on your GitHub account (i.e.&nbsp;<code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, etc) .</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning these skills will be useful down the road if you ever work collaboratively on a project (i.e.&nbsp;writing code as a group). In this scenario, you will use the skills you have been practicing in your projects to work together as a team in a single GitHub repository.</p>
