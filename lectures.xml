<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This lecture will be about <strong>reproducible reporting</strong>, and I want to take the opportunity to cover some basic concepts and ideas that are related to reproducible reporting, just in case you have not heard about it or don not know what it is.</p>
<p>Before we get to <strong>reproducibility</strong>, we need to cover a little background with respect to how science works (even if you are not a scientist, this is important). The basic idea is that in science, <strong>replication</strong> is the most important element of verifying and validating findings. So if you claim that X causes Y, or that Vitamin C improves disease, or that something causes a problem, what happens is that other scientists that are independent of you will try to investigate that same question and see if they come up with a similar result. If lots of different people come up with the same result and replicate the original finding, then we tend to think that the original finding was probably true and that this is a real relationship or real finding.</p>
<p>The ultimate standard in strengthening scientific evidence is replication. The goal is to have independent people to do independent things with different data, different methods, and different laboratories and see if you get the same result. There is a sense that if a relationship in nature is truly there, then it should be robust to having different people discover it in different ways. Replication is particularly important in areas where findings can have big policy impacts or can influence regulatory types of decisions.</p>
<section id="what-is-wrong-with-replication" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-wrong-with-replication">What is wrong with replication?</h3>
<p>There is really nothing wrong with it. This is what science has been doing for a long time, through hundreds of years. And there is nothing wrong with it today. But the problem is that it is becoming more and more challenging to do replication or to replicate other studies. Here are some reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Often times studies are much larger and more costly than previously. If you want to do ten versions of the same study, you need ten times as much money and there is not as much money around as there used to be.</li>
<li>Sometimes it is difficult to replicate a study because if the original study took 20 years to do, it is difficult to wait around another 20 years for replication.</li>
<li>Some studies are just plain unique, such as studying the impact of a massive earthquake in a very specific location and time. If you are looking at a unique situation in time or a unique population, you cannot readily replicate that situation.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a lot of good reasons why you cannot replicate a study. If you cannot replicate a study, is the alternative just to do nothing, just let that study stand by itself?</p>
<p>The idea behind a reproducible reporting is to create a kind of <strong>minimum standard</strong> (or a middle ground) where we will not be replicating a study, but maybe we can do something in between. The basic problem is that you have the gold standard, which is replication, and then you have the worst standard which is doing nothing. What can we do that’s in between the gold standard and doing nothing? That is where reproducibility comes in. That’s how we can kind of bridge the gap between replication and nothing.</p>
<p>In non-research settings, often full replication is not even the point. Often the goal is to preserve something to the point where anybody in an organization can repeat what you did (for example, after you leave the organization). In this case, reproducibility is key to maintaining the history of a project and making sure that every step along the way is clear.</p>

<section id="reproducibility-to-the-rescue" class="level1">
<h1>Reproducibility to the Rescue</h1>
<p>Why do we need this kind of middle ground? I have not clearly defined reproducibility yet, but the basic idea is that you need to make the <strong>data</strong> available for the original study and the <strong>computational methods</strong> available so that other people can look at your data and run the kind of analysis that you have run, and come to the same findings that you found.</p>
<p>What reproducible reporting is about is a <strong>validation of the data analysis</strong>. Because you are not collecting independent data using independent methods, it is a little bit more difficult to validate the scientific question itself. But if you can take someone’s data and reproduce their findings, then you can, in some sense, validate the data analysis.</p>
<p>This involves having the data and the code because more likely than not, the analysis will have been done on the computer using some sort of programming language, like R. So you can take their code and their data and reproduce the findings that they come up with. Then you can at least have confidence that you can reproduce the analysis.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a lot of discussion of reproducibility in the media and in the scientific literature. The journal <em>Science</em> had a special issue on reproducibility and data replication.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.science.org/toc/science/334/6060" class="uri">https://www.science.org/toc/science/334/6060</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Other journals have specific policies to promote reproducibility in manuscripts that are published in their journals. For example, the Journal of American Statistical Association (JASA) requires authors to submit their code and data to reproduce their analyses and a set of Associate Editors of Reproducibility review those materials as part of the review process:</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h3>
<p>Here is an example. In 2012, a feature on the TV show 60 minutes looked at a major incident at Duke University where many results involving a promising cancer test were found to be not reproducible. This led to a number of studies and clinical trials having to be stopped, followed by an investigation which is still ongoing.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-reproducibility">Types of reproducibility</h3>
<p><strong>What are the different kinds of reproducible research?</strong> Enabling reproducibility can be complicated, but by separating out some of the levels and degrees of reproducibility the problem can become more manageable because we can focus our efforts on what best suits our specific scientific domain. <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25340">Victoria Stodden (2014)</a>, a prominent scholar on this topic, has identified some useful distinctions in reproducible research:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Computational reproducibility</strong>: when detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and implementation details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Empirical reproducibility</strong>: when detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific experiments and observations. In practice this is enabled by making data freely available, as well as details of how the data was collected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistical reproducibility</strong>: when detailed information is provided about the choice of statistical tests, model parameters, threshold values, etc. This mostly relates to pre-registration of study design to prevent <em>p</em>-value hacking and other manipulations.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="elements-of-computational-reproducibility">Elements of computational reproducibility</h3>
<p>What do we need for computational reproducibility? There are a variety of ways to talk about this, but one basic definition that we hae come up with is that there are four things that are required to make results reproducible:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Analytic data</strong>. The data that were used for the analysis that was presented should be available for others to access. This is different from the <em>raw data</em> because very often in a data analysis the raw data are not all used for the analysis, but rather some subset is used. It may be interesting to see the raw data but impractical to actually have it. Analytic data is key to examining the data analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analytic code</strong>. The analytic code is the code that was applied to the analytic data to produce the key results. This may be preprocessing code, regression modeling code, or really any other code used to produce the results from the analytic data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation</strong>. Documentation of that code and the data is very important.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distribution</strong>. Finally, there needs to be some standard means of distribution, so all this data in the code is easily accessible.</p></li>

<section id="x-to-computational-x" class="level1">
<h1>“X” to “Computational X”</h1>
<p>What is driving this need for a “reproducibility middle ground” between replication and doing nothing? For starters, there are a lot of new technologies on the scene and in many different fields of study including, biology, chemistry and environmental science. These technologies allow us to collect data at a much higher throughput so we end up with these very complex and very high dimensional data sets. These datasets can be collected almost instantaneously compared to even just ten years ago—the technology has allowed us to create huge data sets at essentially the touch of a button. Furthermore, we the computing power to take existing (already huge) databases and merge them into even bigger and bigger databases. Finally, the massive increase in computing power has allowed us to implement more sophisticated and complex analysis routines.</p>
<p>The analyses themselves, the models that we fit and the algorithms that we run, are much much more complicated than they used to be. Having a basic understanding of these algorithms is difficult, even for a sophisticated person, and it is almost impossible to describe these algorithms with words alone. Understanding what someone did in a data analysis now requires looking at <em>code</em> and scrutinizing the computer programs that people used.</p>
<p>The bottom line with all these different trends is that for every field “X”, there is now “Computational X”. There’s computational biology, computational astronomy—whatever it is you want, there is a computational version of it.</p>
<section id="example-machine-learning-in-the-life-sciences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-machine-learning-in-the-life-sciences">Example: machine learning in the life sciences</h3>
<p>One example of an area where reproducibility is important comes from research that I have conducted in the area of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01256-7">machine learning in the life sciences</a>.</p>
<p>In the above article, computational reproducibility is not throught of as a binary property, but rather it is on a sliding scale that reflects the time needed to reproduce. Published works fall somewhere on this scale, which is bookended by ‘forever’, for a completely irreproducible work, and ‘zero’, for a work where one can automatically repeat the entire analysis with a single keystroke.</p>
<p>As in many cases it is difficult to impose a single standard that divides work into ‘reproducible’ and ‘irreproducible’. Therefore, instead a menu is proposed of three standards with varying degrees of rigor for computational reproducibility:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Bronze standard</strong>. The authors make the data, models and code used in the analysis publicly available. The bronze standard is the minimal standard for reproducibility. Without data, models and code, it is not possible to reproduce a work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Silver standard</strong>. In addition to meeting the bronze standard: (1) the dependencies of the analysis can be downloaded and installed in a single command; (2) key details for reproducing the work are documented, including the order in which to run the analysis scripts, the operating system used and system resource requirements; and (3) all random components in the analysis are set to be deterministic. The silver standard is a midway point between minimal availability and full automation. Works that meet this standard will take much less time to reproduce than ones only meeting the bronze standard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gold standard</strong>. The work meets the silver standard, and the authors make the analysis reproducible with a single command. The gold standard for reproducibility is full automation. When a work meets this standard, it will take little to no effort for a scientist to reproduce it.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="the-data-science-pipeline" class="level1">
<h1>The Data Science Pipeline</h1>
<p>The basic issue is when you read a description of a data analysis, such as in an article or a technical report, for the most part, what you get is the report and nothing else. Of course, everyone knows that behind the scenes there’s <em>a lot</em> that went into this report and that is what I call the <strong>data science pipeline</strong>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.stephaniehicks.com/jhustatcomputing2022/images/dspipeline.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">The Data Science Pipeline</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In this pipeline, there are two “actors”: the <em>author</em> of the report/article and the <em>reader</em>. On the left side, the author is going from left to right along this pipeline. The reader is going from right to left. If you are the reader, you read the article, and you may want to know more about what happened e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are the data?</li>
<li>What methods were used here?</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic idea behind <strong>computational reproducibility</strong> is to focus on the elements in the blue box: the analytic data and the computational results. With computational reproducibility the goal is to allow the author of a report and the reader of that report to “meet in the middle”.</p>
<section id="authors-and-readers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="authors-and-readers">Authors and Readers</h3>
<p>It is important to realize that there are multiple players when you talk about reproducibility–there are different types of parties that have different types of interests. There are <strong>authors</strong> who produce research and they want to make their research reproducible. There are also <strong>readers</strong> of research and they want to reproduce that work. Everyone needs tools to make their lives easier.</p>
<p>One current challenge is that authors of research have to undergo considerable effort to make their results available to a wide audience. Publishing data and code today is not necessarily a trivial task. Although there are a number of resources available now, that were not available even five years ago, it is still a bit of a challenge to get things out on the web (or at least distributed widely). Resources like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://kipoi.org">kipoi</a>, and <a href="http://rpubs.com">RPubs</a> and various data repositories have made a big difference, but there is still a ways to go with respect to building up the public reproducibility infrastructure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even when data and code are available, readers often have to download the data, download the code, and then they have to piece everything together, usually by hand. It’s not always an easy task to put the data and code together. Also, readers may not have the same computational resources that the original authors did. If the original authors used an enormous computing cluster, for example, to do their analysis, the readers may not have that same enormous computing cluster at their disposal. It may be difficult for readers to reproduce the same results.</p>
<p>Generally, the toolbox for doing reproducible research is small, although it’s definitely growing. In practice, authors often just throw things up on the web. There are journals and supplementary materials, but they are famously disorganized. There are only a few central databases that authors can take advantage of to post their data and make it available. So if you are working in a field that has a central database that everyone uses, that is great. If you are not, then you have to assemble your own resources.</p>

<p>I assume you are familiar with how citing references works, and hopefully, you are already using a reference manager. If not, let me know in the discussion boards.</p>
<p>To have something that plays well with R Markdown, you need file format that stores all the references. Click here to learn more other possible file formats available to you to use within a R Markdown file:</p>
<ul>

<section id="citation-management-software" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="citation-management-software">Citation management software</h3>
<p>As you can see, there are ton of file formats including <code>.medline</code> (MEDLINE), <code>.bib</code> (BibTeX), <code>.ris</code> (RIS), <code>.enl</code> (EndNote).</p>
<p>I will not discuss underlying citational management software itself, but I will talk briefly how you might create one of these file formats.</p>
<p>If you recall the output from <code>citation("rmarkdown")</code> above, we might consider manually copying and pasting the output into a citation management software, but instead we can use <code>write_bib()</code> function from <code>knitr</code> package to create a bibliography file ending in <code>.bib</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s run the following code in order to generate a <code>my-refs.bib</code> file</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1">knitr<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">write_bib</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"rmarkdown"</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">file =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"my-refs.bib"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we can see we have the file saved locally.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list.files</span>()</span></code></pre></div>

<pre><code>[1] "index.qmd"       "index.rmarkdown" "my-refs.bib"    </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you open up the <code>my-refs.bib</code> file, you will see</p>

<p>In order to use references within a R Markdown file, you will need to specify the name and a location of a bibliography file using the bibliography metadata field in a YAML metadata section. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span>

<span id="cb7-5"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can include multiple reference files using the following syntax, alternatively you can concatenate two bib files into one.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb8-1"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span>

<p>Now we can start using those bib keys that we have learned just before, using the following syntax</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[@key]</code> for single citation</li>
<li><code>[@key1; @key2]</code> multiple citation can be separated by semi-colon</li>
<li><code>[-@key]</code> in order to suppress author name, and just display the year</li>
<li><code>[see @key1 p 12; also this ref @key2]</code> is also a valid syntax</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s start by citing the <code>rmarkdown</code> package using the following code and press <code>Knit</code> button:</p>
<hr>
<p>I have been using the amazing Rmarkdown package <span class="citation" data-cites="R-rmarkdown">(Allaire et al. 2022)</span>! I should also go and read <span class="citation" data-cites="rmarkdown2018 rmarkdown2020">(Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018; and Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer 2020)</span> books.</p>

<section id="citation-styles" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="citation-styles">Citation styles</h3>
<p>By default, Pandoc will use a Chicago author-date format for citations and references.</p>
<p>To use another style, you will need to specify a CSL (Citation Style Language) file in the <code>csl</code> metadata field, e.g.,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb9-1"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span>

<span id="cb9-6"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div class="resources">
<p>To find your required formats, we recommend using the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/styles">Zotero Style Repository</a>, which makes it easy to search for and download your desired style.</p>
</div>
<p>CSL files can be tweaked to meet custom formatting requirements. For example, we can change the number of authors required before “et al.” is used to abbreviate them. This can be simplified through the use of visual editors such as the one available at https://editor.citationstyles.org.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="add-an-item-to-a-bibliography-without-using-it">Add an item to a bibliography without using it</h4>
<p>By default, the bibliography will only display items that are directly referenced in the document. If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy nocite metadata field and put the citations there.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb10-1"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="add-all-items-to-the-bibliography">Add all items to the bibliography</h4>
<p>If we do not wish to explicitly state all of the items within the bibliography but would still like to show them in our references, we can use the following syntax:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb11-1"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span>

<span id="cb11-3"><span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">---</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will force all items to be displayed in the bibliography.</p>
<div class="resources">
<p>You can also have an appendix appear after bibliography. For more on this, see:</p>

<section id="other-useful-tips" class="level1">
<h1>Other useful tips</h1>
<p>We have learned that inside your file that contains all your references (e.g.&nbsp;<code>my-refs.bib</code>), typically each reference gets a key, which is a shorthand that is generated by the reference manager or you can create yourself.</p>
<p>For instance, I use a format of lower-case first author last name followed by 4 digit year for each reference followed by a keyword (e.g name of a software package). Alternatively, you can omit the keyword. But note that if I cite a paper by the same first author that was published in the same year, then a lower case letter is added to the end. For instance, for a paper that I wrote as 1st author in 2010, my bibtex key might be <code>hicks2022</code> or <code>hicks2022a</code>. You can decide what scheme to use, just pick one and use it <em>forever</em>.</p>
<p>In your R Markdown document, you can then cite the reference by adding the key, such as <code>...in the paper by Hicks et al. [@hicks2022]...</code>.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>One basic idea to make writing reproducible reports easier is what’s known as <em>literate statistical programming</em> (or sometimes called <a href="http://www.r-project.org/conferences/DSC-2001/Proceedings/Rossini.pdf">literate statistical practice</a>). This comes from the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a> in the area of writing computer programs.</p>
<p>The idea is to think of a report or a publication as a stream of text and code. The text is readable by people and the code is readable by computers. The analysis is described in a series of text and code chunks. Each kind of code chunk will do something like load some data or compute some results. Each text chunk will relay something in a human readable language. There might also be presentation code that formats tables and figures and there’s article text that explains what’s going on around all this code. This stream of text and code is a literate statistical program or a literate statistical analysis.</p>
<section id="weaving-and-tangling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weaving-and-tangling">Weaving and Tangling</h3>
<p>Literate programs by themselves are a bit difficult to work with, but they can be processed in two important ways. Literate programs can be <strong>weaved</strong> to produce human readable documents like PDFs or HTML web pages, and they can <strong>tangled</strong> to produce machine-readable “documents”, or in other words, machine readable code. The basic idea behind literate programming in order to generate the different kinds of output you might need, you only need a <em>single source document</em>—you can weave and tangle to get the rest. In order to use a system like this you need a documentational language, that’s human readable, and you need a programming language that’s machine readable (or can be compiled/interpreted into something that’s machine readable).</p>
</section>
<section id="sweave" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sweave">Sweave</h3>
<p>One of the original literate programming systems in R that was designed to do this was called Sweave. Sweave enables users to combine R code with a documentation program called LaTeX. Sweave files ends a <code>.Rnw</code> and have R code weaved through the document:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;plot1, height=4, width=5, eval=FALSE&gt;&gt;=
data(airquality)
plot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Wind)
@</code></pre>
<p>Once you have created your <code>.Rnw</code> file, Sweave will process the file, executing the R chunks and replacing them with output as appropriate before creating the PDF document.</p>
<p>It was originally developed by Fritz Leisch, who is a core member of R, and the code base is still maintained by R Core. The Sweave system comes with any installation of R.</p>
<p>There are many limitations to the original Sweave system. One of the limitations is that it is focused primarily on LaTeX, which is not a documentation language that many people are familiar with. Therefore, it can be difficult to learn this type of markup language if you’re not already in a field that uses it regularly. Sweave also lacks a lot of features that people find useful like caching, and multiple plots per page and mixing programming languages.</p>
<p>Instead, folks have moved towards using something called knitr, which offers everything Sweave does, plus it extends it further. With Sweave, additional tools are required for advanced operations, whereas knitr supports more internally. We’ll discuss knitr below.</p>
</section>
<section id="rmarkdown" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rmarkdown">rmarkdown</h3>
<p>Another choice for literate programming is to build documents based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> language. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension <code>.md.</code>. The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown"><code>rmarkdown</code></a> R package takes a R Markdown file (<code>.Rmd</code>) and weaves together R code chunks like this:</p>
<pre><code>```{r plot1, height=4, width=5, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
data(airquality)
plot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Wind)
```</code></pre>

<p>The authors of the 2nd book describe the motivation for the 2nd book as:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“However, we have received comments from our readers and publisher that it would be beneficial to provide more practical and relatively short examples to show the interesting and useful usage of R Markdown, because it can be daunting to find out how to achieve a certain task from the aforementioned reference book (put another way, that book is too dry to read). As a result, this cookbook was born.”</p>

<p>Before we leave this section, I find that there is quite a bit of terminology to understand the magic behind <code>rmarkdown</code> that can be confusing, so let’s break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>. Pandoc is a command line tool with no GUI that converts documents (e.g.&nbsp;from number of different markup formats to many other formats, such as .doc, .pdf etc). It is completely independent from R (but does come bundled with RStudio).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> (<strong>markup language</strong>). Markdown is a lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension <code>.md.</code> It is completely independent from R.</li>
<li><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=markdown"><code>markdown</code></a> (<strong>R package</strong>). <code>markdown</code> is an R package which converts <code>.md</code> files into HTML. It is no longer recommended for use has been surpassed by <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown"><code>rmarkdown</code></a> (discussed below).</li>
<li>R Markdown (<strong>markup language</strong>). R Markdown is an extension of the markdown syntax. R Markdown files are plain text files that typically have the file extension <code>.Rmd</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown"><code>rmarkdown</code></a> (<strong>R package</strong>). The R package <code>rmarkdown</code> is a library that uses pandoc to process and convert <code>.Rmd</code> files into a number of different formats. This core function is <code>rmarkdown::render()</code>. <strong>Note</strong>: this package only deals with the markdown language. If the input file is e.g.&nbsp;<code>.Rhtml</code> or <code>.Rnw</code>, then you need to use <code>knitr</code> prior to calling pandoc (see below).</li>

<section id="knitr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="knitr">knitr</h3>
<p>One of the alternative that has come up in recent times is something called <code>knitr</code>. The <code>knitr</code> package for R takes a lot of these ideas of literate programming and updates and improves upon them. <code>knitr</code> still uses R as its programming language, but it allows you to mix other programming languages in. You can also use a variety of documentation languages now, such as LaTeX, markdown and HTML. <code>knitr</code> was developed by Yihui Xie while he was a graduate student at Iowa State and it has become a very popular package for writing literate statistical programs.</p>
<p>Knitr takes a plain text document with embedded code, executes the code and ‘knits’ the results back into the document.</p>
<p>For for example, it converts</p>
<ul>
<li>An R Markdown (<code>.Rmd)</code> file into a standard markdown file (<code>.md</code>)</li>
<li>An <code>.Rnw</code> (Sweave) file into to <code>.tex</code> format.</li>
<li>An <code>.Rhtml</code> file into to <code>.html</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The core function is knitr::knit() and by default this will look at the input document and try and guess what type it is e.g.&nbsp;<code>Rnw</code>, <code>Rmd</code> etc.</p>
<p>This core function performs three roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>A source parser, which looks at the input document and detects which parts are code that the user wants to be evaluated.</li>
<li>A code evaluator, which evaluates this code</li>
<li>An output renderer, which writes the results of evaluation back to the document in a format which is interpretable by the raw output type. For instance, if the input file is an <code>.Rmd</code>, the output render marks up the output of code evaluation in <code>.md</code> format.</li>
</ul>

<p>As seen in the figure above, from there pandoc is used to convert e.g.&nbsp;a <code>.md</code> file into many other types of file formats into a <code>.html</code>, etc.</p>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on).”</p>

<h1>Websites and Books in R Markdown</h1>
<p>Now that you are on the road to using R Markdown documents, it is important to know about other wonderful things you do with these documents. For example, let’s say you have multiple <code>.Rmd</code> documents that you want to put together into a website, blog, book, etc.</p>
<p>There are primarily two ways to build multiple <code>.Rmd</code> documents together:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><strong>blogdown</strong></a> for building websites</li>
<li><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/"><strong>bookdown</strong></a> for authoring books</li>
</ol>
<p>In this section, we briefly introduce both packages, but it’s worth mentioning that the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html"><strong>rmarkdown</strong> package also has a built-in site generator</a> to build websites.</p>

<p>The <code>blogdown</code> R package is built on top of R Markdown, supports multi-page HTML output to write a blog post or a general page in an Rmd document, or a plain Markdown document. These source documents (e.g.&nbsp;<code>.Rmd</code> or <code>.md</code>) are built into a static website (i.e.&nbsp;a bunch of static HTML files, images and CSS files). Using this folder of files, it is very easy to publish it to any web server as a website. Also, it is easy to maintain because it is only a single folder.</p>

<p>Other really great examples can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://awesome-blogdown.com" class="uri">https://awesome-blogdown.com</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other advantages include the content likely being reproducible, easier to maintain, and easy to convert pages to e.g.&nbsp;PDF or other formats in the future if you do not want to convert to HTML files. Because it is based on the Markdown syntax, it is easy to write technical documents, including math equations, insert figures or tables with captions, cross-reference with figure or table numbers, add citations, and present theorems or proofs.</p>
<p>Here’s a video you can watch of someone making a blogdown website.</p>

<p>Similar to <code>blogdown</code>, the <code>bookdown</code> R package is built on top of R Markdown, but also offers features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, inserting parts/appendices, and imported the GitBook style (https://www.gitbook.com) to create elegant and appealing HTML book pages.

<p>There is another great way to build blogs or websites using the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/distill/">distill for R Markdown</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/distill" class="uri">https://rstudio.github.io/distill</a></li>

<p>Distill for R Markdown combines the technical authoring features of the <a href="https://github.com/distillpub/template">Distill web framework</a> (optimized for scientific and technical communication) with <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a>, enabling a fully reproducible workflow based on literate programming <span class="citation" data-cites="knuth1984">(Knuth 1984)</span>.</p>
<p>Distill articles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reader-friendly typography that adapts well to mobile devices.</li>
<li>Features essential to technical writing like LaTeX math, citations, and footnotes.</li>
<li>Flexible figure layout options (e.g.&nbsp;displaying figures at a larger width than the article text).</li>
<li>Attractively rendered tables with optional support for pagination.</li>
<li>Support for a wide variety of diagramming tools for illustrating concepts. The ability to incorporate JavaScript and D3-based interactive visualizations.</li>
<li>A variety of ways to publish articles, including support for publishing sets of articles as a Distill website or as a Distill blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Th3 course website from last year was built in Distill for R Markdown:</p>

</ul>
<p>Some other cool things about distill is the use of footnotes and asides.</p>
<p>For example <sup>1</sup>. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.</p>
<p>You can also optionally include notes in the gutter of the article (immediately to the right of the article text). To do this use the aside tag.</p>
<aside>
This content will appear in the gutter of the article.

<p>To insert a comment:</p>
<pre><code>command + Shift + C on Mac
Ctrl + Shift + C on Windows</code></pre>
<p>This shortcut can be used both for:</p>
<ul>
<li>R code when you want to comment your code. It will add a <code>#</code> at the beginning of the line</li>
<li>for text in R Markdown. It will add <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code> around the text</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if you want to comment more than one line, select all the lines you want to comment then use the shortcut. If you want to uncomment a comment, apply the same shortcut.</p>
</section>
<section id="knit-a-r-markdown-document" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="knit-a-r-markdown-document">Knit a R Markdown document</h3>
<p>You can knit R Markdown documents by using this shortcut:</p>
<pre><code>command + Shift + K on Mac
Ctrl + Shift + K on Windows</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="code-snippets" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-snippets">Code snippets</h3>
<p>Code snippets is usually a few characters long and is used as a shortcut to insert a common piece of code. You simply type a few characters then press <code>Tab</code> and it will complete your code with a larger code. <code>Tab</code> is then used again to navigate through the code where customization is required. For instance, if you type <code>fun</code> then press <code>Tab</code>, it will auto-complete the code with the required code to create a function:</p>
<pre><code>name &lt;- function(variables) {
  
}</code></pre>
<p>Pressing <code>Tab</code> again will jump through the placeholders for you to edit it. So you can first edit the name of the function, then the variables and finally the code inside the function (try by yourself!).</p>
<p>There are many code snippets by default in RStudio. Here are the code snippets I use most often:</p>

<section id="ordered-list-in-r-markdown" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ordered-list-in-r-markdown">Ordered list in R Markdown</h3>
<p>In R Markdown, when creating an ordered list such as this one:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>
<li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of bothering with the numbers and typing</p>
<pre><code>1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3</code></pre>
<p>you can simply type</p>
<pre><code>1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3</code></pre>
<p>for the exact same result (try it yourself or check the code of this article!). This way you do not need to bother which number is next when creating a new item.</p>
<p>To go even further, any numeric will actually render the same result as long as the first item is the number you want to start from. For example, you could type:</p>
<pre><code>1. Item 1
7. Item 2
3. Item 3</code></pre>
<p>which renders</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>
<li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
<p>However, I suggest always using the number you want to start from for all items because if you move one item at the top, the list will start with this new number. For instance, if we move <code>7. Item 2</code> from the previous list at the top, the list becomes:</p>
<pre><code>7. Item 2
1. Item 1
3. Item 3</code></pre>
<p>which incorrectly renders</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Item 2</li>
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 3</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-code-chunk-in-r-markdown">New code chunk in R Markdown</h3>
<p>When editing R Markdown documents, you will need to insert a new R code chunk many times. The following shortcuts will make your life easier:</p>
<pre><code>command + option + I on Mac (or command + alt + I depending on your keyboard)
Ctrl + ALT + I on Windows</code></pre>

<section id="reformat-code" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reformat-code">Reformat code</h3>
<p>A clear and readable code is always easier and faster to read (and look more professional when sharing it to collaborators). To automatically apply the most common coding guidelines such as white spaces, indents, etc., use:</p>
<pre><code>cmd + Shift + A on Mac
Ctrl + Shift + A on Windows</code></pre>
<p>So for example the following code which does not respect the guidelines (and which is not easy to read):</p>
<pre><code>1+1
  for(i in 1:10){if(!i%%2){next}
print(i)
 }</code></pre>
<p>becomes much more neat and readable:</p>
<pre><code>1 + 1
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (!i %% 2) {
    next
  }
  print(i)
}</code></pre>

<p>RStudio addins are extensions which provide a simple mechanism for executing advanced R functions from within RStudio. In simpler words, when executing an addin (by clicking a button in the Addins menu), the corresponding code is executed without you having to write the code. RStudio addins have the advantage that they allow you to execute complex and advanced code much more easily than if you would have to write it yourself.</p>

<h1>Overview and history of R</h1>
<p>Below is a very quick introduction to R, to get you set up and running. We’ll go deeper into R and coding later.</p>
<section id="tldr-r-in-a-nutshell" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr-r-in-a-nutshell">tl;dr (R in a nutshell)</h3>
<p>Like every programming language, R has its advantages and disadvantages. If you search the internet, you will quickly discover lots of folks with opinions about R. Some of the features that are useful to know are:</p>
<ul>
<li>R is open-source, freely accessible, and cross-platform (multiple OS).</li>
<li>R is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">“high-level” programming language</a>, relatively easy to learn.
<ul>
<li>While “Low-level” programming languages (e.g.&nbsp;Fortran, C, etc) often have more efficient code, they can also be harder to learn because it is designed to be close to a machine language.</li>
<li>In contrast, high-level languages deal more with variables, objects, functions, loops, and other abstract CS concepts with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>R is great for statistics, data analysis, websites, web apps, data visualizations, and so much more!</li>
<li>R integrates easily with document preparation systems like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLaTeX">, but R files can also be used to create <code>.docx</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.html</code>, <code>.ppt</code> files with integrated R code output and graphics.</li>
<li>The R Community is very dynamic, helpful and welcoming.
<ul>
<li>Check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats">#rstats</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rtistry">#rtistry</a> on Twitter, <a href="https://www.tidytuesday.com">TidyTuesday</a> podcast and community activity in the <a href="https://www.rfordatasci.com">R4DS Online Learning Community</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/">r/rstats</a> subreddit.</li>
<li>If you are looking for more local resources, check out <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-baltimore/">R-Ladies Baltimore</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Through R packages, it is easy to get lots of state-of-the-art algorithms.</li>
<li>Documentation and help files for R are generally good.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we use R in this course, it is not the only option to analyze data. Maybe the most similar to R, and widely used, is Python, which is also free. There is also commercial software that can be used to analyze data (e.g., Matlab, Mathematica, Tableau, SAS, SPSS). Other more general programming languages are suitable for certain types of analyses as well (e.g., C, Fortran, Perl, Java, Julia).</p>
<p>Depending on your future needs or jobs, you might have to learn one or several of those additional languages. The good news is that even though those languages are all different, they all share general ways of thinking and structuring code. So once you understand a specific concept (e.g., variables, loops, branching statements or functions), it applies to all those languages. Thus, learning a new programming language is much easier once you already know one. And R is a good one to get started with.</p>
<p>With the skills gained in this course, hopefully you will find R a fun and useful programming language for your future projects.</p>

<section id="basic-features-of-r" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-features-of-r">Basic Features of R</h3>
<p>Today R runs on almost any standard computing platform and operating system. Its open source nature means that anyone is free to adapt the software to whatever platform they choose. Indeed, R has been reported to be running on modern tablets, phones, PDAs, and game consoles.</p>
<p>One nice feature that R shares with many popular open source projects is frequent releases. These days there is a major annual release, typically in October, where major new features are incorporated and released to the public. Throughout the year, smaller-scale bugfix releases will be made as needed. The frequent releases and regular release cycle indicates active development of the software and ensures that bugs will be addressed in a timely manner. Of course, while the core developers control the primary source tree for R, many people around the world make contributions in the form of new feature, bug fixes, or both.</p>
<p>Another key advantage that R has over many other statistical packages (even today) is its sophisticated graphics capabilities. R’s ability to create “publication quality” graphics has existed since the very beginning and has generally been better than competing packages. Today, with many more visualization packages available than before, that trend continues. R’s base graphics system allows for very fine control over essentially every aspect of a plot or graph. Other newer graphics systems, like lattice and ggplot2 allow for complex and sophisticated visualizations of high-dimensional data.</p>
<p>R has maintained the original S philosophy (see box below), which is that <strong>it provides a language that is both useful for interactive work, but contains a powerful programming language for developing new tools</strong>. This allows the user, who takes existing tools and applies them to data, to slowly but surely become a developer who is creating new tools.</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>For a great discussion on an overview and history of R and the S programming language, read through <a href="https://rdpeng.github.io/Biostat776/lecture-introduction-and-overview.html">this chapter</a> from Roger D. Peng.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, one of the joys of using R has nothing to do with the language itself, but rather with the active and vibrant user community. In many ways, a language is successful inasmuch as it creates a platform with which many people can create new things. R is that platform and thousands of people around the world have come together to make contributions to R, to develop packages, and help each other use R for all kinds of applications. The R-help and R-devel mailing lists have been highly active for over a decade now and there is considerable activity on web sites like Stack Overflow, Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats">#rstats</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rtistry">#rtistry</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/">Reddit</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="free-software" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="free-software">Free Software</h3>
<p>A major advantage that R has over many other statistical packages and is that it’s free in the sense of free software (it’s also free in the sense of free beer). The copyright for the primary source code for R is held by the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/foundation/">R Foundation</a> and is published under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU General Public License version 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Free Software Foundation, with <em>free software</em>, you are granted the following <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four freedoms</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).</p></li>
<li><p>The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p></li>
<li><p>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</p></li>
<li><p>The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p></li>

<section id="design-of-the-r-system" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="design-of-the-r-system">Design of the R System</h3>
<p>The primary R system is available from the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">Comprehensive R Archive Network</a>, also known as CRAN. CRAN also hosts many add-on packages that can be used to extend the functionality of R.</p>
<p>The R system is divided into 2 conceptual parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The “base” R system that you download from CRAN:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/">Linux</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">Mac</a></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Everything else.</li>
</ol>
<p>R functionality is divided into a number of <em>packages</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The “base” R system contains, among other things, the <code>base</code> package which is required to run R and contains the most fundamental functions.</p></li>
<li><p>The other packages contained in the “base” system include <code>utils</code>, <code>stats</code>, <code>datasets</code>, <code>graphics</code>, <code>grDevices</code>, <code>grid</code>, <code>methods</code>, <code>tools</code>, <code>parallel</code>, <code>compiler</code>, <code>splines</code>, <code>tcltk</code>, <code>stats4</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also “Recommended” packages: <code>boot</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>cluster</code>, <code>codetools</code>, <code>foreign</code>, <code>KernSmooth</code>, <code>lattice</code>, <code>mgcv</code>, <code>nlme</code>, <code>rpart</code>, <code>survival</code>, <code>MASS</code>, <code>spatial</code>, <code>nnet</code>, <code>Matrix</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you download a fresh installation of R from CRAN, you get all of the above, which represents a substantial amount of functionality. However, there are many other packages available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are over 10,000 packages on CRAN that have been developed by users and programmers around the world.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also many packages associated with the <a href="http://bioconductor.org">Bioconductor project</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>People often make packages available on their personal websites; there is no reliable way to keep track of how many packages are available in this fashion.</p></li>

<section id="limitations-of-r" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-of-r">Limitations of R</h3>
<p>No programming language or statistical analysis system is perfect. R certainly has a number of drawbacks. For starters, R is essentially based on <strong>almost 50 year old technology</strong>, going back to the original S system developed at Bell Labs. There was originally little built in support for dynamic or 3-D graphics (but things have improved greatly since the “old days”).</p>
<p>Another commonly cited limitation of R is that <strong>objects must generally be stored in physical memory</strong> (though this is increasingly not true anymore). This is in part due to the scoping rules of the language, but R generally is more of a memory hog than other statistical packages. However, there have been a number of advancements to deal with this, both in the R core and also in a number of packages developed by contributors. Also, computing power and capacity has continued to grow over time and amount of physical memory that can be installed on even a consumer-level laptop is substantial. While we will likely never have enough physical memory on a computer to handle the increasingly large datasets that are being generated, the situation has gotten quite a bit easier over time.</p>
<p>At a higher level one “limitation” of R is that <strong>its functionality is based on consumer demand and (voluntary) user contributions</strong>. If no one feels like implementing your favorite method, then it’s <em>your</em> job to implement it (or you need to pay someone to do it). The capabilities of the R system generally reflect the interests of the R user community. As the community has ballooned in size over the past 10 years, the capabilities have similarly increased. When I first started using R, there was very little in the way of functionality for the physical sciences (physics, astronomy, etc.). However, now some of those communities have adopted R and we are seeing more code being written for those kinds of applications.</p>

<section id="rstudio-default-options" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rstudio-default-options">RStudio default options</h3>
<p>To first get set up, I highly recommend changing the following setting</p>
<p>Tools &gt; Global Options (or <code>Cmd + ,</code> on macOS)</p>
<p>Under the <strong>General</strong> tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>workspace</strong>
<ul>
<li>Uncheck restore .RData into workspace at startup</li>
<li>Save workspace to .RData on exit : “Never”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For <strong>History</strong>
<ul>
<li>Uncheck “Always save history (even when not saving .RData)</li>
<li>Uncheck “Remove duplicate entries in history”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that you won’t save the objects and other things that you create in your R session and reload them. This is important for two reasons</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>: you don’t want to have objects from last week cluttering your session</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong>: you don’t want to save private data or other things to your session. You only want to read these in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your “history” is the commands that you have entered into R.</p>
<p>Additionally, not saving your history means that you won’t be relying on things that you typed in the last session, which is a good habit to get into!</p>

<section id="installing-and-loading-r-packages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-and-loading-r-packages">Installing and loading R packages</h3>
<p>As we discussed, most of the functionality and features in R come in the form of add-on packages. There are tens of thousands of packages available, some big, some small, some well documented, some not. We will be using many different packages in this course. Of course, you are free to install and use any package you come across for any of the assignments.</p>
<p>The “official” place for packages is the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">CRAN website</a>. If you are interested in packages on a specific topic, the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/">CRAN task views</a> provide curated descriptions of packages sorted by topic.</p>
<p>To install an R package from CRAN, one can simply call the <code>install.packages()</code> function and pass the name of the package as an argument. For example, to install the <code>ggplot2</code> package from CRAN: open RStudio,go to the R prompt (the <code>&gt;</code> symbol) in the lower-left corner and type</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">install.packages</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"ggplot2"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>and the appropriate version of the package will be installed.</p>
<p>Often, a package needs other packages to work (called dependencies), and they are installed automatically. It usually does not matter if you use a single or double quotation mark around the name of the package.</p>

Questions
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<ol type="1">
<li>As you installed the <code>ggplot2</code> package, what other packages were installed?</li>
<li>What happens if you tried to install <code>GGplot2</code>?</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>It could be that you already have all packages required by <code>ggplot2</code> installed. In that case, you will not see any other packages installed. To see which of the packages above <code>ggplot2</code> needs (and thus installs if it is not present), type into the R console:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1">tools<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">package_dependencies</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"ggplot2"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>In RStudio, you can also install (and update/remove) packages by clicking on the ‘Packages’ tab in the bottom right window.</p>
<p>It is very common these days for packages to be developed on GitHub. It is possible to install packages from GitHub directly. Those usually contain the latest version of the package, with features that might not be available yet on the CRAN website. Sometimes, in early development stages, a package is only on GitHub until the developer(s) feel it is good enough for CRAN submission. So installing from GitHub gives you the latest. The downside is that packages under development can often be buggy and not working right. To install packages from GitHub, you need to install the <code>remotes</code> package and then use the following function</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1">remotes<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">install_github</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>We will not do that now, but it is quite likely that at one point later in this course we will.</p>
<p>You only need to install a package once, unless you upgrade/re-install R. Once installed, you still need to load the package before you can use it. That has to happen every time you start a new R session. You do that using the <code>library()</code> command. For instance to load the <code>ggplot2</code> package, type</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'ggplot2'</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>You may or may not see a short message on the screen. Some packages show messages when you load them, and others do not.</p>
<p>This was a quick overview of R packages. We will use a lot of them, so you will get used to them rather quickly.</p>

<section id="getting-started-in-rstudio" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-started-in-rstudio">Getting started in RStudio</h3>
<p>While one can use R and do pretty much every task, including all the ones we cover in this class, without using RStudio, RStudio is very useful, has lots of features that make your R coding life easier and has become pretty much the default integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Since RStudio has lots of features, it takes time to learn them. A good resource to learn more about RStudio are the <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/">R Studio Essentials</a> collection of videos.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Welcome! I am very excited to have you in our one-term (i.e.&nbsp;half a semester) course on Statistical Computing course number (140.776) offered by the <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics">Department of Biostatistics</a> at the <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</a>.</p>
<p>This course is designed for ScM and PhD students at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I am pretty flexible about permitting outside students, but I want everyone to be aware of the goals and assumptions so no one feels like they are surprised by how the class works.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The primary goal of the course is to teach you practical programming and computational skills required for the research and application of statistical methods.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This class is not designed to teach the theoretical aspects of statistical or computational methods, but rather the goal is to help with the <strong>practical issues</strong> related to setting up a statistical computing environment for data analyses, developing high-quality R packages, conducting reproducible data analyses, best practices for data visualization and writing code, and creating websites for personal or project use.</p>
<section id="assumptions-and-pre-requisites" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assumptions-and-pre-requisites">Assumptions and pre-requisites</h3>
<p>The course is designed for students in the Johns Hopkins Biostatistics Masters and PhD programs. However, we do not assume a significant background in statistics. Specifically we assume:</p>
<section id="you-know-the-basics-of-at-least-one-programming-language-e.g.-r-or-python" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="you-know-the-basics-of-at-least-one-programming-language-e.g.-r-or-python">1. You know the basics of at least one programming language (e.g.&nbsp;R or Python)</h4>
<ul>
<li>If it’s not R, we assume that you are willing to spend the time to learn R</li>
<li>You have heard of things such as control structures, functions, loops, etc</li>
<li>Know the difference between different data types (e.g.&nbsp;character, numeric, etc)</li>
<li>Know the basics of plotting (e.g.&nbsp;what is a scatterplot, histogram, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="you-know-the-basics-of-computing-environments">2. You know the <strong>basics</strong> of computing environments</h4>
<ul>
<li>You have access to a computing environment (i.e.&nbsp;locally on a laptop or working in the cloud)</li>
<li>You generally feel comfortable with installing and working with software</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="you-know-the-basics-of-statistics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="you-know-the-basics-of-statistics">3. You know the <strong>basics</strong> of statistics</h4>
<ul>
<li>The central dogma (estimates, standard errors, basic distributions, etc.)</li>
<li>Key statistical terms and methods</li>
<li>Differences between estimation vs testing vs prediction</li>
<li>Know how to fit and interpret <strong>basic</strong> statistical models (e.g.&nbsp;linear models)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="you-know-the-basics-of-reproducible-research" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="you-know-the-basics-of-reproducible-research">4. You know the <strong>basics</strong> of reproducible research</h4>
<ul>
<li>Difference between replication and reproducible</li>
<li>Know how to cite references (e.g.&nbsp;like in a publication)</li>
<li>Somewhat familiar with tools that enable reproducible research (In complete transparency, we will briefly cover these topics in the first week, but depending on your comfort level with them, this may impact whether you choose to continue with the course).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the target audience for this course is advanced students in statistics we will not be able to spend significant time covering these concepts and technologies. To give you some idea about how these prerequisites will impact your experience in the course, we will be turning in all assignments via R Markdown documents and you will be encouraged (not required) to use git/GitHub to track changes to your code over time. The majority of the assignments will involve learning the practical issues around performing data analyses, building software packages, building websites, etc all using the R programming language. Data analyses you will perform will also often involve significant data extraction, cleaning, and transformation. We will learn about tools to do all of this, but hopefully most of this sounds familiar to you so you can focus on the concepts we will be teaching around best practices for statistical computing.</p>

<p>You must install <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">R</a> and <a href="https://rstudio.com">RStudio</a> on your computing environment in order to complete this course.</p>
<p>These are two <strong>different</strong> applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>R is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course</p></li>
<li><p>RStudio is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both R and RStudio are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux. Please download the version that is suitable for your computing setup.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, we will make use of numerous R add-on packages that must be installed over the Internet. Packages can be installed using the <code>install.packages()</code> function in R. For example, to install the <code>tidyverse</code> package, you can run</p>

<p>The course instructor this year is <a href="https://www.stephaniehicks.com">Stephanie Hicks</a> who is a Associate Professor in the <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics">Department of Biostatistics</a> at the <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</a>, a faculty member of the <a href="http://jhudatascience.org">Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab</a>, and have affiliations with the <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu">Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</a>, <a href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/people.php">Center for Computational Biology</a>, the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/institute-genetic-medicine/education-training/predoctoral-human-genetics">Department of Genetic Medicine</a>, and the <a href="http://www.jhu-bmb-phd.org/faculty/stephanie-hicks">Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</a>.</p>
<p>My research focuses on developing fast, scalable, statistical methodology and open-source software for genomics and biomedical data analysis for human health and disease. My research is <strong>problem-forward</strong>: I develop statistical methods and software that are motivated by concrete problems, often with real-world, noisy, messy data. I’m also interested in developing theory for how to incorporate <em>design thinking</em> (alongside <em>statistical thinking</em>) in practice of data analysis.</p>
<p>If you want, you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/stephaniehicks">Twitter</a>. I’m also a co-host of the <a href="https://twitter.com/CorrespondAuth">The Corresponding Author</a> podcast, member of the <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board">Editorial Board for <em>Genome Biology</em></a>, an Associate Editor for <a href="https://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide/">Reproducibility</a> at the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/uasa20/current">Journal of the American Statistical Association</a>, and co-founder of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-baltimore/">R-Ladies Baltimore</a>.</p>
<p>We also have a couple of amazing TAs this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phyllis Wei (<a href="ywei43@jhu.edu">ywei43@jhu.edu</a>). She is a second-year Ph.D.&nbsp;student in Biostatistics. She develops methods to help understand the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases and enhance disease risk prediction models through data integration. Outside of biostatistics, she enjoys hiking, baking, and visiting museums.</li>
<li>Joe Sartini (<a href="jsartin1@jhu.edu">jsartin1@jhu.edu</a>). He is a second year Ph.D.&nbsp;student in Biostatistics, with interest in models for precision medicine applications. Currently, the focus of his work is extracting meaningful insights from time-series produced by Continuous Glucose Monitoring and other devices worn by Type 2 diabetics. Outside of research, he enjoys participating in endurance sports and weightlifting.</li>

</div>
</div>
<p>For many, 2021 and 2022 have continued to be incredibly tough (e.g.&nbsp;coordinating school online, challenges with visas and travel, an economic crisis, ). As your instructor, I am <em>ultra</em> sympathetic to family challenges and life challenges (fwiw, I have three small children).</p>
<p>While the <code>140.776.01</code> section will be held in person here in this room, it is strongly likely that one or more times I will send out a class email the night before (or maybe even the morning of) lecture to let you know that I need to move the class to zoom for the day. I apologize in advance, but I will do my best to give as much advance notice as I can.</p>
<p>With that in mind, my goal is to make as much of the class asynchronous as possible so you can work whenever you have time. My plan is to be as understanding as possible when it comes to grading, and any issues that come up with the course. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me (or the TAs) if you are having issues and we will do our best to direct you to whatever resources we have/accommodate you however we can.</p>
<p>I think the material in this course is important, fun, and this is an opportunity to learn a lot. But life is more important than a course and if there was ever a time that life might get in the way of learning, it’s likely now.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grading">Grading</h3>
<section id="philosophy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="philosophy">Philosophy</h4>
<p>We believe the purpose of graduate education is to train you to be able to think for yourself and initiate and complete your own projects. We are super excited to talk to you about ideas, work out solutions with you, and help you to figure out how to produce professional data analyses. We do not think that graduate school grades are important for this purpose. This means that we do not care very much about graduate student grades.</p>
<p>That being said, we have to give you a grade so they will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A - Excellent - 90%+</li>
<li>B - Passing - 80%+</li>
<li>C - Needs improvement - 70%+</li>
</ul>
<p>We rarely give out grades below a C and if you consistently submit work, and do your best you are very likely to get an A or a B in the course.</p>
</section>
<section id="relative-weights" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relative-weights">Relative weights</h4>
<p>The grades are based on three projects (plus one entirely optional project to help you get set up). The breakdown of grading will be</p>
<ul>
<li>33% for Project 1</li>
<li>33% for Project 2</li>
<li>34% for Project 3</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submit an project solution, it is your own work, and it meets a basic level of completeness and effort you will get 100% for that project. If you submit a project solution, but it doesn’t meet basic completeness and effort you will receive 50%. If you do not submit an solution you will receive 0%.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="submitting-assignments" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="submitting-assignments">Submitting assignments</h3>
<p>Please write up your project solutions using R Markdown. In some cases, you will compile a R Markdown file into an HTML file and submit your HTML file to the dropbox on Courseplus. In other cases, you may create an R package or website. In all of the above, when applicable, show all your code and provide as much explanation / documentation as you can.</p>
<p>For each project, we will provide a time when we download the materials. We will assume whatever version we download at that time is what you are turning in.</p>
</section>
<section id="reproducibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h3>
<p>We will talk about reproducibility a bit during class, and it will be a part of the homework assignments as well. Reproducibility of scientific code is very challenging, so the faculty and TAs completely understand difficulties that arise. But we think that it is important that you practice reproducible research. In particular, your project assignments should perform the tasks that you are asked to do and create the figures and tables you are asked to make as a part of the compilation of your document. We will have some pointers for some issues that have come up as we announce the projects.</p>
</section>
<section id="code-of-conduct" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of course participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any work event, including group meetings, conferences, talks, parties, Twitter and other online media. This code of conduct applies to all course participants, including instructors and TAs, and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, including GitHub project repos, Slack channels, and Twitter.</p>
<p>Course participants violating these rules will be referred to leadership of the Department of Biostatistics and the Title IX coordinator at JHU and may face expulsion from the class.</p>
<p>All class participants agree to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be considerate</strong> in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of other members.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful</strong>. Disagreements happen, but do not require poor behavior or poor manners. Frustration is inevitable, but it should never turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Course participants should be respectful both of the other course participants and those outside the course.</li>
<li><strong>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech</strong>. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert Stephanie Hicks.</li>
<li><strong>Take care of each other</strong>. Refrain from advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. And, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Alert Stephanie Hicks if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Introduction to git/GitHub</h1>
<p>This document gives a brief explanation of GitHub and how we will use it for this course.</p>
<section id="git" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="git">git</h3>
<p><em>Git</em> is what is called a <em>version control system</em> for file management. The main idea is that as you (and your collaborators) work on a project, the software tracks, and records any changes made by anyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the “track changes” features in Microsoft Word, but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files</li>
<li>Great for solo or collaborative work</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="github" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="github">GitHub</h3>
<p><em>GitHub</em> is a hosting service on internet for git-aware folders and projects</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the DropBox or Google, but more structured, powerful, and programmatic</li>
<li>Great for solo or collaborative work!</li>
<li>Technically <em>GitHub</em> is distinct from <em>Git</em>. However, <em>GitHub</em> is in some sense the interface and <em>Git</em> the underlying engine (a bit like <em>RStudio</em> and <em>R</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we will only be using <em>Git</em> through <em>GitHub</em>, I tend to not distinguish between the two. In the following, I refer to all of it as just <em>GitHub</em>. Note that other interfaces to <em>Git</em> exist, e.g., <em>Bitbucket</em>, but <em>GitHub</em> is the most widely used one.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1531">Source: PhD Comics</a>]</p>
<p><em>GitHub</em> gives you a clean way to track your projects. It is also very well suited to collaborative work. Historically, version control was used for software development. However, it has become broader and is now used for many types of projects, including data science projects.</p>
<p>To learn a bit more about Git/GitHub and why you might want to use it, <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/">read this article by Jenny Bryan</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note her explanation of what’s special with the <code>README.md</code> file on GitHub.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="what-to-not-do" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-to-not-do">What to (not) do</h3>
<p><strong>GitHub is ideal if</strong> you have a project with a fair number of files, most of those files are text files (such as code, LaTeX, (R)markdown, etc.) and different people work on different parts of the project.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub is less useful if</strong> you have a lot of non-text files (e.g.&nbsp;Word or Powerpoint) and different team members might want to edit the same document at the same time. In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+Onedrive, etc. might be better.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-use-gitgithub" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-use-gitgithub">How to use Git/GitHub</h3>
<p>Git and GitHub is fundamentally <strong>based on commands you type into the command line</strong>. Lots of online resources show you how to use the command line. This is the most powerful, and the way I almost always interact with git/GitHub. However, many folks find this the most confusing way to use git/GitHub. Alternatively, there are graphical interfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub itself</a> provides a grapical interface with basic functionality.</li>
<li>RStudio also has <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html">Git/GitHub integration</a>. Of course this only works for R project GitHub integration.</li>
<li>There are also third party GitHub clients with many advanced features, most of which you won’t need initially, but might eventually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As student, you can (and should) upgrade to the Pro version of GitHub for free (i.e.&nbsp;access to unlimited private repositories is one benefit), see the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub student developer pack</a> on how to do this.</p>
</section>

<section id="getting-started" class="level1">
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>One of my favorite resources for getting started with git/GitHub is the Happy Git with R from Jenny Bryan:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://happygitwithr.com" class="uri">https://happygitwithr.com</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="cell">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A screenshot of the Happy Git with R online book from Jenny Bryan</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It truly is one of the <strong>best resources</strong> out there for getting started with git/GitHub, especially with the integration to RStudio. Therefore, at this point, I will encourage all of you to go read through the online book.</p>
<p>Some of you may only need to skim it, others will need to spend some time reading through it. Either way, I will bet that you won’t regret the time investment.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-gitgithub-in-our-course" class="level1">
<h1>Using git/GitHub in our course</h1>
<p>In this course, you will use git/GitHub in the following ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Project 0 (optional) - You will create a website introducing yourself to folks in the course and deploy it on GitHub.</li>
<li>Projects 1-3 - You can practice using git locally (on your compute environment) to track your changes over time and, if you wish (but highly suggested), you can practice pushing your project solutions to a private GitHub repository on your GitHub account (i.e.&nbsp;<code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, etc) .</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning these skills will be useful down the road if you ever work collaboratively on a project (i.e.&nbsp;writing code as a group). In this scenario, you will use the skills you have been practicing in your projects to work together as a team in a single GitHub repository.</p>
