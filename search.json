Please email (use the Subject line: 140.776 Setup) the Course Instructor (Dr. Stephanie Hicks) at shicks19@jhu.edu the following information:\n\nSetting up your computing environment\n\nYour name, JHED ID (if applicable).\nThe type of computer/operating system you are using (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux, other)\nThe version of R that you have installed on your computer. To do this, start up R and run the following in the R console and include the output in your email.\n\n\nprint(R.version.string)\n\n\n\n\nPrinting the R version string\n\n\n\nThe version of RStudio that you have installed on your computer. To do this start up RStudio and in the R console window, run the following and again include the output in your email:\n\n\nprint(RStudio.Version()$version)\n\n\nIf you have a GitHub username, please include this in your email. If you do not have a GitHub username, read https://happygitwithr.com, sign up for GitHub, and include your new username in your email to me.\nTo make sure git is installed on your system, use the ‘Terminal’ (e.g. it’s next to the R Console within RStudio) (or whatever you use), run the following and include the output in your email:\n\nFor example, this is mine:\n\ngit --version\n\ngit version 2.32.1 (Apple Git-133)\n\n\nIf you have any trouble with any of the steps above, try to first post on the discussion board on CoursePlus. The TAs and I will be checking it frequently, but other students may also be helpful in their replies. You can also use other resources to get help (Google, R4DS, colleagues/friends/relatives with R/Markdown experience, etc.). Still, try to do as much as possible yourself. We will use all the bits you are learning here repeatedly during this course.\n\n\n\nPart 2\nThis part of the project is to help you introduce yourself (and your interests!) to others in this course. You will create a new GitHub repository and build a small website about yourself.\n\n1. Create a GitHub repo for your website\nCreate a new GitHub repository titled biostat776-intro-<firstname>-<lastname> (where you replace <firstname> with your first name and <lastname> with your last name) in your own personal GitHub account (e.g. https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/biostat776-intro-<firstname>-<lastname>).\nFor example, you can find an example that I created for myself at\n\ngithub repo: https://github.com/stephaniehicks/biostat776-intro-stephanie-hicks\n\n\n\n2. Build a website using R Markdown\nUsing one of the many ways we discussed in class (e.g. a simple R Markdown website, blogdown, distill, etc), create a new project in RStudio with the appropriate files. For example, you might include the following information:\n\nWrite a short summary introducing yourself. Structure the webpage with headings, subheadings, etc. Talk a bit about yourself, your background, training, research interests. Let me/us know what kind of statistics, programming, data analysis experience you already have. I am also curious to know what you most hope to learn in this course.\nFive fun facts about yourself\nA web page linking to something you think is really cool/interesting/inspiring/etc. You could also describe briefly what it is and why you like it.\n\nIf you want, feel free to get creative and include other things. You can play with RMarkdown if you wish to, e.g., you can try to include some table or a video, etc.\n\n\n3. Include a README.md file\nYour project repository should include a README.md file (if it was not included already).\nEdit the repository README.md file. Typically it will only contain the name of your repository with a # sign in front. The # represents a level 1 heading in Markdown. Change the headline and call it “Introducing myself” (or something like that). Underneath write something like “This website contains a short introduction of Your Name.”\nMake sure the 2 files (README.md and especially index.Rmd / index.html) look the way you want. Make changes until everything works.\n\n\n4. Deploy your website\nDepending on how you want to deploy your website, the following may or may not be relevant to you. In general, you want to make sure you have initialized your project to use git (i.e. you can type git init to initialize the repository to use git. Add and commit your changes. Push your changes and deploy your website.\nFollowing steps 2-4, here is my example website:\n\nwebsite: https://www.stephaniehicks.com/biostat776-intro-stephanie-hicks\n\n\n\n5. Share your website\n\nGo to the Discussion Board in CoursePlus and write a short post with a link (URL) to your website (and URL to the corresponding GitHub repository) that you created.\nAs you read the introductions from other folks in the class, feel free to comment/reply using Discussion board.\n\nIn class on Sept 8, I will show as many websites as I can from Courseplus!"

The basic idea is that in science, replication is the most important element of verifying and validating findings. So if you claim that X causes Y, or that Vitamin C improves disease, or that something causes a problem, what happens is that other scientists that are independent of you will try to investigate that same question and see if they come up with a similar result. If lots of different people come up with the same result and replicate the original finding, then we tend to think that the original finding was probably true and that this is a real relationship or real finding.\nThe ultimate standard in strengthening scientific evidence is replication. The goal is to have independent people to do independent things with different data, different methods, and different laboratories and see if you get the same result. There is a sense that if a relationship in nature is truly there, then it should be robust to having different people discover it in different ways. Replication is particularly important in areas where findings can have big policy impacts or can influence regulatory types of decisions.\n\nWhat is wrong with replication?\nThere is really nothing wrong with it. This is what science has been doing for a long time, through hundreds of years. And there is nothing wrong with it today. But the problem is that it is becoming more and more challenging to do replication or to replicate other studies. Here are some reasons:\n\nOften times studies are much larger and more costly than previously. If you want to do ten versions of the same study, you need ten times as much money and there is not as much money around as there used to be.\nSometimes it is difficult to replicate a study because if the original study took 20 years to do, it is difficult to wait around another 20 years for replication.\nSome studies are just plain unique, such as studying the impact of a massive earthquake in a very specific location and time. If you are looking at a unique situation in time or a unique population, you cannot readily replicate that situation.\n\nThere are a lot of good reasons why you cannot replicate a study. If you cannot replicate a study, is the alternative just to do nothing, just let that study stand by itself?\nThe idea behind a reproducible reporting is to create a kind of minimum standard (or a middle ground) where we will not be replicating a study, but maybe we can do something in between. The basic problem is that you have the gold standard, which is replication, and then you have the worst standard which is doing nothing. What can we do that’s in between the gold standard and doing nothing? That is where reproducibility comes in. That’s how we can kind of bridge the gap between replication and nothing.\nIn non-research settings, often full replication is not even the point. Often the goal is to preserve something to the point where anybody in an organization can repeat what you did (for example, after you leave the organization). In this case, reproducibility is key to maintaining the history of a project and making sure that every step along the way is clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nReplication, whereby scientific questions are examined and verified independently by different scientists, is the gold standard for scientific validity.\nReplication can be difficult and often there are no resources to independently replicate a study.\nReproducibility, whereby data and code are re-analyzed by independent scientists to obtain the same results of the original investigator, is a reasonable minimum standard when replication is not possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility to the Rescue\nWhy do we need this kind of middle ground? I have not clearly defined reproducibility yet, but the basic idea is that you need to make the data available for the original study and the computational methods available so that other people can look at your data and run the kind of analysis that you have run, and come to the same findings that you found.\nWhat reproducible reporting is about is a validation of the data analysis. Because you are not collecting independent data using independent methods, it is a little bit more difficult to validate the scientific question itself. But if you can take someone’s data and reproduce their findings, then you can, in some sense, validate the data analysis.\nThis involves having the data and the code because more likely than not, the analysis will have been done on the computer using some sort of programming language, like R. So you can take their code and their data and reproduce the findings that they come up with. Then you can at least have confidence that you can reproduce the analysis.\nRecently, there has been a lot of discussion of reproducibility in the media and in the scientific literature. The journal Science had a special issue on reproducibility and data replication.\n\nhttps://www.science.org/toc/science/334/6060\n\nOther journals have specific policies to promote reproducibility in manuscripts that are published in their journals. For example, the Journal of American Statistical Association (JASA) requires authors to submit their code and data to reproduce their analyses and a set of Associate Editors of Reproducibility review those materials as part of the review process:\n\nhttps://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide\n\n\nWhy does this matter?\nHere is an example. In 2012, a feature on the TV show 60 minutes looked at a major incident at Duke University where many results involving a promising cancer test were found to be not reproducible. This led to a number of studies and clinical trials having to be stopped, followed by an investigation which is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n[Source on YouTube]\n\n\nTypes of reproducibility\nWhat are the different kinds of reproducible research? Enabling reproducibility can be complicated, but by separating out some of the levels and degrees of reproducibility the problem can become more manageable because we can focus our efforts on what best suits our specific scientific domain. Victoria Stodden (2014), a prominent scholar on this topic, has identified some useful distinctions in reproducible research:\n\nComputational reproducibility: when detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and implementation details.\nEmpirical reproducibility: when detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific experiments and observations. In practice this is enabled by making data freely available, as well as details of how the data was collected.\nStatistical reproducibility: when detailed information is provided about the choice of statistical tests, model parameters, threshold values, etc. This mostly relates to pre-registration of study design to prevent p-value hacking and other manipulations.\n\n[Source]\n\n\nElements of computational reproducibility\nWhat do we need for computational reproducibility? There are a variety of ways to talk about this, but one basic definition that we hae come up with is that there are four things that are required to make results reproducible:\n\nAnalytic data. The data that were used for the analysis that was presented should be available for others to access. This is different from the raw data because very often in a data analysis the raw data are not all used for the analysis, but rather some subset is used. It may be interesting to see the raw data but impractical to actually have it. Analytic data is key to examining the data analysis.\nAnalytic code. The analytic code is the code that was applied to the analytic data to produce the key results. This may be preprocessing code, regression modeling code, or really any other code used to produce the results from the analytic data.\nDocumentation. Documentation of that code and the data is very important.\nDistribution. Finally, there needs to be some standard means of distribution, so all this data in the code is easily accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nReproducible reporting is about is a validation of the data analysis\nThere are multiple types of reproducibility\nThere are four elements to computational reproducibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“X” to “Computational X”\nWhat is driving this need for a “reproducibility middle ground” between replication and doing nothing? For starters, there are a lot of new technologies on the scene and in many different fields of study including, biology, chemistry and environmental science. These technologies allow us to collect data at a much higher throughput so we end up with these very complex and very high dimensional data sets. These datasets can be collected almost instantaneously compared to even just ten years ago—the technology has allowed us to create huge data sets at essentially the touch of a button. Furthermore, we the computing power to take existing (already huge) databases and merge them into even bigger and bigger databases. Finally, the massive increase in computing power has allowed us to implement more sophisticated and complex analysis routines.\nThe analyses themselves, the models that we fit and the algorithms that we run, are much much more complicated than they used to be. Having a basic understanding of these algorithms is difficult, even for a sophisticated person, and it is almost impossible to describe these algorithms with words alone. Understanding what someone did in a data analysis now requires looking at code and scrutinizing the computer programs that people used.\nThe bottom line with all these different trends is that for every field “X”, there is now “Computational X”. There’s computational biology, computational astronomy—whatever it is you want, there is a computational version of it.\n\nExample: machine learning in the life sciences\nOne example of an area where reproducibility is important comes from research that I have conducted in the area of machine learning in the life sciences.\nIn the above article, computational reproducibility is not throught of as a binary property, but rather it is on a sliding scale that reflects the time needed to reproduce. Published works fall somewhere on this scale, which is bookended by ‘forever’, for a completely irreproducible work, and ‘zero’, for a work where one can automatically repeat the entire analysis with a single keystroke.\nAs in many cases it is difficult to impose a single standard that divides work into ‘reproducible’ and ‘irreproducible’. Therefore, instead a menu is proposed of three standards with varying degrees of rigor for computational reproducibility:\n\nBronze standard. The authors make the data, models and code used in the analysis publicly available. The bronze standard is the minimal standard for reproducibility. Without data, models and code, it is not possible to reproduce a work.\nSilver standard. In addition to meeting the bronze standard: (1) the dependencies of the analysis can be downloaded and installed in a single command; (2) key details for reproducing the work are documented, including the order in which to run the analysis scripts, the operating system used and system resource requirements; and (3) all random components in the analysis are set to be deterministic. The silver standard is a midway point between minimal availability and full automation. Works that meet this standard will take much less time to reproduce than ones only meeting the bronze standard.\nGold standard. The work meets the silver standard, and the authors make the analysis reproducible with a single command. The gold standard for reproducibility is full automation. When a work meets this standard, it will take little to no effort for a scientist to reproduce it.\n\n\n\n\nThe Data Science Pipeline\nThe basic issue is when you read a description of a data analysis, such as in an article or a technical report, for the most part, what you get is the report and nothing else. Of course, everyone knows that behind the scenes there’s a lot that went into this report and that is what I call the data science pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe Data Science Pipeline\n\n\nIn this pipeline, there are two “actors”: the author of the report/article and the reader. On the left side, the author is going from left to right along this pipeline. The reader is going from right to left. If you are the reader, you read the article, and you may want to know more about what happened e.g.\n\nWhere are the data?\nWhat methods were used here?\n\nThe basic idea behind computational reproducibility is to focus on the elements in the blue box: the analytic data and the computational results. With computational reproducibility the goal is to allow the author of a report and the reader of that report to “meet in the middle”.\n\nAuthors and Readers\nIt is important to realize that there are multiple players when you talk about reproducibility–there are different types of parties that have different types of interests. There are authors who produce research and they want to make their research reproducible. There are also readers of research and they want to reproduce that work. Everyone needs tools to make their lives easier.\nOne current challenge is that authors of research have to undergo considerable effort to make their results available to a wide audience. Publishing data and code today is not necessarily a trivial task. Although there are a number of resources available now, that were not available even five years ago, it is still a bit of a challenge to get things out on the web (or at least distributed widely). Resources like GitHub, kipoi, and RPubs and various data repositories have made a big difference, but there is still a ways to go with respect to building up the public reproducibility infrastructure.\nFurthermore, even when data and code are available, readers often have to download the data, download the code, and then they have to piece everything together, usually by hand. It’s not always an easy task to put the data and code together. Also, readers may not have the same computational resources that the original authors did. If the original authors used an enormous computing cluster, for example, to do their analysis, the readers may not have that same enormous computing cluster at their disposal. It may be difficult for readers to reproduce the same results.\nGenerally, the toolbox for doing reproducible research is small, although it’s definitely growing. In practice, authors often just throw things up on the web. There are journals and supplementary materials, but they are famously disorganized. There are only a few central databases that authors can take advantage of to post their data and make it available. So if you are working in a field that has a central database that everyone uses, that is great. If you are not, then you have to assemble your own resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nThe process of conducting and disseminating research can be depicted as a “data science pipeline”\nReaders and consumers of data science research are typically not privy to the details of the data science pipeline\nOne view of reproducibility is that it gives research consumers partial access to the raw pipeline elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-lecture materials\n\nFinal Questions\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between replication and reproducible?\nWhy can replication be difficult to achieve? Why is reproducibility a reasonable minimum standard when replication is not possible?\nWhat is needed to reproduce the results of a data analysis?"

    "text": "Learning objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\n\n\n\nAt the end of this lesson you will:\n\nBe able to define literate programming\nRecognize differences between available tools to for literate programming\nKnow how to efficiently work within RStudio for efficient literate programming\nCreate a R Markdown document\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nOne basic idea to make writing reproducible reports easier is what’s known as literate statistical programming (or sometimes called literate statistical practice). This comes from the idea of literate programming in the area of writing computer programs.\nThe idea is to think of a report or a publication as a stream of text and code. The text is readable by people and the code is readable by computers. The analysis is described in a series of text and code chunks. Each kind of code chunk will do something like load some data or compute some results. Each text chunk will relay something in a human readable language. There might also be presentation code that formats tables and figures and there’s article text that explains what’s going on around all this code. This stream of text and code is a literate statistical program or a literate statistical analysis.\n\nWeaving and Tangling\nLiterate programs by themselves are a bit difficult to work with, but they can be processed in two important ways. Literate programs can be weaved to produce human readable documents like PDFs or HTML web pages, and they can tangled to produce machine-readable “documents”, or in other words, machine readable code. The basic idea behind literate programming in order to generate the different kinds of output you might need, you only need a single source document—you can weave and tangle to get the rest. In order to use a system like this you need a documentational language, that’s human readable, and you need a programming language that’s machine readable (or can be compiled/interpreted into something that’s machine readable).\n\n\nSweave\nOne of the original literate programming systems in R that was designed to do this was called Sweave. Sweave enables users to combine R code with a documentation program called LaTeX. Sweave files ends a .Rnw and have R code weaved through the document:\n<<plot1, height=4, width=5, eval=FALSE>>=\ndata(airquality)\nplot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Wind)\n@\nOnce you have created your .Rnw file, Sweave will process the file, executing the R chunks and replacing them with output as appropriate before creating the PDF document.\nIt was originally developed by Fritz Leisch, who is a core member of R, and the code base is still maintained by R Core. The Sweave system comes with any installation of R.\nThere are many limitations to the original Sweave system. One of the limitations is that it is focused primarily on LaTeX, which is not a documentation language that many people are familiar with. Therefore, it can be difficult to learn this type of markup language if you’re not already in a field that uses it regularly. Sweave also lacks a lot of features that people find useful like caching, and multiple plots per page and mixing programming languages.\nInstead, folks have moved towards using something called knitr, which offers everything Sweave does, plus it extends it further. With Sweave, additional tools are required for advanced operations, whereas knitr supports more internally. We’ll discuss knitr below.\n\n\nrmarkdown\nAnother choice for literate programming is to build documents based on Markdown language. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension .md.. The rmarkdown R package takes a R Markdown file (.Rmd) and weaves together R code chunks like this:\n```{r plot1, height=4, width=5, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}\ndata(airquality)\nplot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Wind)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe best resource for learning about R Markdown this by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund:\n\nhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown\n\nThe R Markdown Cookbook by Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, and Emily Riederer is really good too:\n\nhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook\n\nThe authors of the 2nd book describe the motivation for the 2nd book as:\n\n“However, we have received comments from our readers and publisher that it would be beneficial to provide more practical and relatively short examples to show the interesting and useful usage of R Markdown, because it can be daunting to find out how to achieve a certain task from the aforementioned reference book (put another way, that book is too dry to read). As a result, this cookbook was born.”\n\n\n\nBecause this is lecture is built in a .Rmd file, let’s demonstrate how this work. I am going to change eval=FALSE to eval=TRUE.\n\ndata(airquality)\nplot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Wind)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we not see the back ticks ``` anymore in the code chunk above that made the plot?\nWhat do you think we should do if we want to have the code executed, but we want to hide the code that made it?\n\n\nBefore we leave this section, I find that there is quite a bit of terminology to understand the magic behind rmarkdown that can be confusing, so let’s break it down:\n\nPandoc. Pandoc is a command line tool with no GUI that converts documents (e.g. from number of different markup formats to many other formats, such as .doc, .pdf etc). It is completely independent from R (but does come bundled with RStudio).\nMarkdown (markup language). Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension .md. It is completely independent from R.\nmarkdown (R package). markdown is an R package which converts .md files into HTML. It is no longer recommended for use has been surpassed by rmarkdown (discussed below).\nR Markdown (markup language). R Markdown is an extension of the markdown syntax. R Markdown files are plain text files that typically have the file extension .Rmd.\nrmarkdown (R package). The R package rmarkdown is a library that uses pandoc to process and convert .Rmd files into a number of different formats. This core function is rmarkdown::render(). Note: this package only deals with the markdown language. If the input file is e.g. .Rhtml or .Rnw, then you need to use knitr prior to calling pandoc (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCheck out the R Markdown Quick Tour for more:\n\nhttps://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by Allison Horst on RMarkdown\n\n\n\n\nknitr\nOne of the alternative that has come up in recent times is something called knitr. The knitr package for R takes a lot of these ideas of literate programming and updates and improves upon them. knitr still uses R as its programming language, but it allows you to mix other programming languages in. You can also use a variety of documentation languages now, such as LaTeX, markdown and HTML. knitr was developed by Yihui Xie while he was a graduate student at Iowa State and it has become a very popular package for writing literate statistical programs.\nKnitr takes a plain text document with embedded code, executes the code and ‘knits’ the results back into the document.\nFor for example, it converts\n\nAn R Markdown (.Rmd) file into a standard markdown file (.md)\nAn .Rnw (Sweave) file into to .tex format.\nAn .Rhtml file into to .html.\n\nThe core function is knitr::knit() and by default this will look at the input document and try and guess what type it is e.g. Rnw, Rmd etc.\nThis core function performs three roles:\n\nA source parser, which looks at the input document and detects which parts are code that the user wants to be evaluated.\nA code evaluator, which evaluates this code\nAn output renderer, which writes the results of evaluation back to the document in a format which is interpretable by the raw output type. For instance, if the input file is an .Rmd, the output render marks up the output of code evaluation in .md format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting a Rmd file to many outputs using knitr and pandoc\n\n\n\n\n[Source]\nAs seen in the figure above, from there pandoc is used to convert e.g. a .md file into many other types of file formats into a .html, etc.\nSo in summary:\n\n“R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on).”\n\n[Source]\n\n\n\nCreate and Knit Your First R Markdown Document\n\n\nWhen creating your first R Markdown document, in RStudio you can\n\nGo to File > New File > R Markdown…\nFeel free to edit the Title\nMake sure to select “Default Output Format” to be HTML\nClick “OK”. RStudio creates the R Markdown document and places some boilerplate text in there just so you can see how things are setup.\nClick the “Knit” button (or go to File > Knit Document) to make sure you can create the HTML output\n\nIf you successfully knit your first R Markdown document, then congratulations!\n\n\n\n\n\nMission accomplished!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsites and Books in R Markdown\nNow that you are on the road to using R Markdown documents, it is important to know about other wonderful things you do with these documents. For example, let’s say you have multiple .Rmd documents that you want to put together into a website, blog, book, etc.\nThere are primarily two ways to build multiple .Rmd documents together:\n\nblogdown for building websites\nbookdown for authoring books\n\nIn this section, we briefly introduce both packages, but it’s worth mentioning that the rmarkdown package also has a built-in site generator to build websites.\n\nblogdown\n\n\n\n\n\nblogdown logo\n\n\n\n\n[Source]\nThe blogdown R package is built on top of R Markdown, supports multi-page HTML output to write a blog post or a general page in an Rmd document, or a plain Markdown document. These source documents (e.g. .Rmd or .md) are built into a static website (i.e. a bunch of static HTML files, images and CSS files). Using this folder of files, it is very easy to publish it to any web server as a website. Also, it is easy to maintain because it is only a single folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor example, my personal website was built in blogdown:\n\nhttps://www.stephaniehicks.com\n\nOther really great examples can be found here:\n\nhttps://awesome-blogdown.com\n\n\n\nOther advantages include the content likely being reproducible, easier to maintain, and easy to convert pages to e.g. PDF or other formats in the future if you do not want to convert to HTML files. Because it is based on the Markdown syntax, it is easy to write technical documents, including math equations, insert figures or tables with captions, cross-reference with figure or table numbers, add citations, and present theorems or proofs.\nHere’s a video you can watch of someone making a blogdown website.\n\n\n\n\n[Source on YouTube]\n\n\nbookdown\n\n\n\n\n\nbook logo\n\n\n\n\n[Source]\nSimilar to blogdown, the bookdown R package is built on top of R Markdown, but also offers features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, inserting parts/appendices, and imported the GitBook style (https://www.gitbook.com) to create elegant and appealing HTML book pages. Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor example, the previous version of this course was built in bookdown:\n\nhttps://rdpeng.github.io/Biostat776\n\nAnother example is the Tidyverse Skills for Data Science book that the JHU Data Science Lab wrote. The github repo that contains all the .Rmd files can be found here.\n\nhttps://jhudatascience.org/tidyversecourse\nhttps://github.com/jhudsl/tidyversecourse\n\n\n\nNote: Even though the word “book” is in “bookdown”, this package is not only for books. It really can be anything that consists of multiple .Rmd documents meant to be read in a linear sequence such as course dissertation/thesis, handouts, study notes, a software manual, a thesis, or even a diary.\n\nhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics-examples.html#examples-books\n\n\n\ndistill\nThere is another great way to build blogs or websites using the distill for R Markdown.\n\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/distill\n\nDistill for R Markdown combines the technical authoring features of the Distill web framework (optimized for scientific and technical communication) with R Markdown, enabling a fully reproducible workflow based on literate programming (Knuth 1984).\nDistill articles include:\n\nReader-friendly typography that adapts well to mobile devices.\nFeatures essential to technical writing like LaTeX math, citations, and footnotes.\nFlexible figure layout options (e.g. displaying figures at a larger width than the article text).\nAttractively rendered tables with optional support for pagination.\nSupport for a wide variety of diagramming tools for illustrating concepts. The ability to incorporate JavaScript and D3-based interactive visualizations.\nA variety of ways to publish articles, including support for publishing sets of articles as a Distill website or as a Distill blog.\n\nTh3 course website from last year was built in Distill for R Markdown:\n\nWebsite: https://stephaniehicks.com/jhustatcomputing2021\nGithub: https://github.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatcomputing2021\n\nSome other cool things about distill is the use of footnotes and asides.\nFor example 1. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.\nYou can also optionally include notes in the gutter of the article (immediately to the right of the article text). To do this use the aside tag.\n\nThis content will appear in the gutter of the article.\n\nYou can also include figures in the gutter. Just enclose the code chunk which generates the figure in an aside tag\n\n\n\nTips and tricks in R Markdown in RStudio\nHere are shortcuts and tips on efficiently using RStudio to improve how you write code.\n\nRun code\nIf you want to run a code chunk:\ncommand + Enter on Mac\nCtrl + Enter on Windows\n\n\nInsert a comment in R and R Markdown\nTo insert a comment:\ncommand + Shift + C on Mac\nCtrl + Shift + C on Windows\nThis shortcut can be used both for:\n\nR code when you want to comment your code. It will add a # at the beginning of the line\nfor text in R Markdown. It will add <!-- and --> around the text\n\nNote that if you want to comment more than one line, select all the lines you want to comment then use the shortcut. If you want to uncomment a comment, apply the same shortcut.\n\n\nKnit a R Markdown document\nYou can knit R Markdown documents by using this shortcut:\ncommand + Shift + K on Mac\nCtrl + Shift + K on Windows\n\n\nCode snippets\nCode snippets is usually a few characters long and is used as a shortcut to insert a common piece of code. You simply type a few characters then press Tab and it will complete your code with a larger code. Tab is then used again to navigate through the code where customization is required. For instance, if you type fun then press Tab, it will auto-complete the code with the required code to create a function:\nname <- function(variables) {\n  \n}\nPressing Tab again will jump through the placeholders for you to edit it. So you can first edit the name of the function, then the variables and finally the code inside the function (try by yourself!).\nThere are many code snippets by default in RStudio. Here are the code snippets I use most often:\n\nlib to call library()\n\n\nlibrary(package)\n\n\nmat to create a matrix\n\n\nmatrix(data, nrow = rows, ncol = cols)\n\n\nif, el, and ei to create conditional expressions such as if() {}, else {} and else if () {}\n\n\nif (condition) {\n  \n}\n\nelse {\n  \n}\n\nelse if (condition) {\n  \n}\n\n\nfun to create a function\n\n\nname <- function(variables) {\n  \n}\n\n\nfor to create for loops\n\n\nfor (variable in vector) {\n  \n}\n\n\nts to insert a comment with the current date and time (useful if you have very long code and share it with others so they see when it has been edited)\n\n\n# Tue Jan 21 20:20:14 2020 ------------------------------\n\nYou can see all default code snippets and add yours by clicking on Tools > Global Options… > Code (left sidebar) > Edit Snippets…\n\n\nOrdered list in R Markdown\nIn R Markdown, when creating an ordered list such as this one:\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\nItem 3\n\nInstead of bothering with the numbers and typing\n1. Item 1\n2. Item 2\n3. Item 3\nyou can simply type\n1. Item 1\n1. Item 2\n1. Item 3\nfor the exact same result (try it yourself or check the code of this article!). This way you do not need to bother which number is next when creating a new item.\nTo go even further, any numeric will actually render the same result as long as the first item is the number you want to start from. For example, you could type:\n1. Item 1\n7. Item 2\n3. Item 3\nwhich renders\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\nItem 3\n\nHowever, I suggest always using the number you want to start from for all items because if you move one item at the top, the list will start with this new number. For instance, if we move 7. Item 2 from the previous list at the top, the list becomes:\n7. Item 2\n1. Item 1\n3. Item 3\nwhich incorrectly renders\n\nItem 2\nItem 1\nItem 3\n\n\n\nNew code chunk in R Markdown\nWhen editing R Markdown documents, you will need to insert a new R code chunk many times. The following shortcuts will make your life easier:\ncommand + option + I on Mac (or command + alt + I depending on your keyboard)\nCtrl + ALT + I on Windows\n\n\nReformat code\nA clear and readable code is always easier and faster to read (and look more professional when sharing it to collaborators). To automatically apply the most common coding guidelines such as white spaces, indents, etc., use:\ncmd + Shift + A on Mac\nCtrl + Shift + A on Windows\nSo for example the following code which does not respect the guidelines (and which is not easy to read):\n1+1\n  for(i in 1:10){if(!i%%2){next}\nprint(i)\n }\nbecomes much more neat and readable:\n1 + 1\nfor (i in 1:10) {\n  if (!i %% 2) {\n    next\n  }\n  print(i)\n}\n\n\nRStudio addins\nRStudio addins are extensions which provide a simple mechanism for executing advanced R functions from within RStudio. In simpler words, when executing an addin (by clicking a button in the Addins menu), the corresponding code is executed without you having to write the code. RStudio addins have the advantage that they allow you to execute complex and advanced code much more easily than if you would have to write it yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor more information about RStudio addins, check out:\n\nhttps://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins\nhttps://statsandr.com/blog/tips-and-tricks-in-rstudio-and-r-markdown\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers\nSimilar to many other programs, you can also use:\n\ncommand + Shift + N on Mac and Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows to open a new R Script\ncommand + S on Mac and Ctrl + S on Windows to save your current script or R Markdown document\n\nCheck out Tools –> Keyboard Shortcuts Help to see a long list of these shortcuts.\n\n\n\nPost-lecture materials\n\nFinal Questions\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat is literate programming?\nWhat was the first literate statistical programming tool to weave together a statistical language (R) with a markup language (LaTeX)?\nWhat is knitr and how is different than other literate statistical programming tools?\nWhere can you find a list of other commands that help make your code writing more efficient in RStudio?\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nRMarkdown Tips and Tricks by Indrajeet Patil\nhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown\nhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.
