We will not discuss the mathematical details of specific data analysis approaches, however some statistical background and being comfortable with quantitative thinking are useful. Previous experience with writing computer programs in general and R in particular is also helpful, but not necessary. If you have no programming experience, expect to spend extra time getting yourself familiar with R. As long as you are willing to invest the time to learn the programming and you do not mind thinking quantitatively, you should be able to take the course, independent of your background.\nFormal requirement for the course is Biostatistics 140.621. Knowledge of material from 140.621 is assumed. If you didn’t take this course, please contact me to get permission to enroll.\n\nGetting set up\nYou must install R and RStudio on your computer in order to complete this course. These are two different applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:\n\nR is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course\nRStudio is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler\n\nBoth R and RStudio are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux. Please download the version that is suitable for your computing setup.\nThroughout the course, we will make use of numerous R add-on packages that must be installed over the Internet. Packages can be installed using the install.packages() function in R. For example, to install the tidyverse package, you can run\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nin the R console.\n\nHow to Download R for Windows\nGo to https://cran.r-project.org and\n\nClick the link to “Download R for Windows”\nClick on “base”\nClick on “Download R 4.2.1 for Windows”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe version in the video is not the latest version.

    "text": "Part 1\nThis part of the project is to ensure that you have successfully set up your computing environment. Please email (use the Subject line: 140.776 Setup) the Course Instructor (Dr. Stephanie Hicks) at shicks19@jhu.edu the following information:\n\nSetting up your computing environment\n\nYour name, JHED ID (if applicable).\nThe type of computer/operating system you are using (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux, other)\nThe version of R that you have installed on your computer. To do this, start up R and run the following in the R console and include the output in your email.\n\n\nprint(R.version.string)\n\n\n\n\nPrinting the R version string\n\n\n\nThe version of RStudio that you have installed on your computer. To do this start up RStudio and in the R console window, run the following and again include the output in your email:\n\n\nprint(RStudio.Version()$version)\n\n\nIf you have a GitHub username, please include this in your email. If you do not have a GitHub username, read https://happygitwithr.com, sign up for GitHub, and include your new username in your email to me.\nTo make sure git is installed on your system, use the ‘Terminal’ (e.g. it’s next to the R Console within RStudio) (or whatever you use), run the following and include the output in your email:\n\nFor example, this is mine:\n\ngit --version\n\ngit version 2.32.1 (Apple Git-133)\n\n\nIf you have any trouble with any of the steps above, try to first post on the discussion board on CoursePlus. The TAs and I will be checking it frequently, but other students may also be helpful in their replies. You can also use other resources to get help (Google, R4DS, colleagues/friends/relatives with R/Markdown experience, etc.). Still, try to do as much as possible yourself. We will use all the bits you are learning here repeatedly during this course.\n\n\n\nPart 2\nThis part of the project is to help you introduce yourself (and your interests!) to others in this course. You will create a new GitHub repository and build a small website about yourself.\n\n1. Create a GitHub repo for your website\nCreate a new GitHub repository titled biostat776-intro-<firstname>-<lastname> (where you replace <firstname> with your first name and <lastname> with your last name) in your own personal GitHub account (e.g. https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/biostat776-intro-<firstname>-<lastname>).\nFor example, you can find an example that I created for myself at\n\ngithub repo: https://github.com/stephaniehicks/biostat776-intro-stephanie-hicks\n\n\n\n2. Build a website using R Markdown\nUsing one of the many ways we discussed in class (e.g. a simple R Markdown website, blogdown, distill, etc), create a new project in RStudio with the appropriate files. For example, you might include the following information:\n\nWrite a short summary introducing yourself. Structure the webpage with headings, subheadings, etc. Talk a bit about yourself, your background, training, research interests. Let me/us know what kind of statistics, programming, data analysis experience you already have. I am also curious to know what you most hope to learn in this course.\nFive fun facts about yourself\nA web page linking to something you think is really cool/interesting/inspiring/etc. You could also describe briefly what it is and why you like it.\n\nIf you want, feel free to get creative and include other things. You can play with RMarkdown if you wish to, e.g., you can try to include some table or a video, etc.\n\n\n3. Include a README.md file\nYour project repository should include a README.md file (if it was not included already).\nEdit the repository README.md file. Typically it will only contain the name of your repository with a # sign in front. The # represents a level 1 heading in Markdown. Change the headline and call it “Introducing myself” (or something like that). Underneath write something like “This website contains a short introduction of Your Name.”\nMake sure the 2 files (README.md and especially index.Rmd / index.html) look the way you want. Make changes until everything works.\n\n\n4. Deploy your website\nDepending on how you want to deploy your website, the following may or may not be relevant to you. In general, you want to make sure you have initialized your project to use git (i.e. you can type git init to initialize the repository to use git. Add and commit your changes. Push your changes and deploy your website.\nFollowing steps 2-4, here is my example website:\n\nwebsite: https://www.stephaniehicks.com/biostat776-intro-stephanie-hicks\n\n\n\n5. Share your website\n\nGo to the Discussion Board in CoursePlus and write a short post with a link (URL) to your website (and URL to the corresponding GitHub repository) that you created.\nAs you read the introductions from other folks in the class, feel free to comment/reply using Discussion board.\n\nIn class on Sept 8, I will show as many websites as I can from Courseplus!"
