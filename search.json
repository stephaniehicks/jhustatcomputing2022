For this course we will be using R version 4.2.1. You can determine what version of R you have by starting up R and typing into the console R.version.string and hitting the return/enter key. If you do not have the proper version of R installed, go to CRAN and download and install the latest version.\nWe will also make use of the RStudio interactive development environment (IDE). RStudio requires that R be installed, and so is an “add-on” to R. You can obtain the RStudio Desktop for free from the RStudio web site. In particular, we will make heavy use of it when developing R packages. It is also essential that you have the latest release of RStudio. You can determine the version of RStudio by looking at menu item Help > About RStudio. You should be using RStudio version 1.4.1106 or higher."

We will not discuss the mathematical details of specific data analysis approaches, however some statistical background and being comfortable with quantitative thinking are useful. Previous experience with writing computer programs in general and R in particular is also helpful, but not necessary. If you have no programming experience, expect to spend extra time getting yourself familiar with R. As long as you are willing to invest the time to learn the programming and you do not mind thinking quantitatively, you should be able to take the course, independent of your background.\nFormal requirement for the course is Biostatistics 140.621. Knowledge of material from 140.621 is assumed. If you didn’t take this course, please contact me to get permission to enroll.\n\nGetting set up\nYou must install R and RStudio on your computer in order to complete this course. These are two different applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:\n\nR is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course\nRStudio is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler\n\nBoth R and RStudio are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux. Please download the version that is suitable for your computing setup.\nThroughout the course, we will make use of numerous R add-on packages that must be installed over the Internet. Packages can be installed using the install.packages() function in R. For example, to install the tidyverse package, you can run\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nin the R console.\n\nHow to Download R for Windows\nGo to https://cran.r-project.org and\n\nClick the link to “Download R for Windows”\nClick on “base”\nClick on “Download R 4.2.1 for Windows”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe version in the video is not the latest version.
