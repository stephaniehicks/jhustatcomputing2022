If you forget to close a quote, you'll see `+`\n\n```r\n> \"This is a string without a closing quote\n+ \n+ \n+ HELP I'M STUCK\n```\n\nIf this happen to you, take a deep breath, press `Escape` and try again.\n:::\n\nMultiple strings are often stored in a character vector, which you can create with `c()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"one\"   \"two\"   \"three\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# `grepl()`\n\nOne of the **most basic functions in R that uses regular expressions** is the `grepl(pattern, x)` function, which takes **two arguments** and **returns a logical**: \n\n1. A regular expression (`pattern`)\n2. A string to be searched (`x`)\n\nIn case you are curious, \"grepl\" literally translates to \"grep logical\".\n\nIf the string (`x`) contains the specified regular expression (`pattern`), then `grepl()` will return `TRUE`, otherwise it will return `FALSE`.\n\nLet's take a look at one example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nregular_expression <- \"a\"\nstring_to_search <- \"Maryland\"\n\ngrepl(pattern = regular_expression, x = string_to_search)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the example above, we specify the regular expression `\"a\"` and store it in a variable called `regular_expression`.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Note\n\n**Remember** that regular expressions are just strings!\n:::\n\nWe also store the string `\"Maryland\"` in a variable called `string_to_search`. \n\nThe regular expression `\"a\"` represents a single occurrence of the character `\"a\"`. Since `\"a\"` is contained within `\"Maryland\"`, `grepl()` returns the value `TRUE`.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Example\n\nLet's try another simple example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nregular_expression <- \"u\"\nstring_to_search <- \"Maryland\"\n\ngrepl(pattern = regular_expression, x = string_to_search)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe regular expression `\"u\"` represents a single occurrence of the character `\"u\"`, which is not a sub-string of `\"Maryland\"`, therefore `grepl()` returns the value `FALSE`.\n:::\n\nRegular expressions can be much longer than single characters. You could for example search for smaller strings inside of a larger string:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"land\", \"Maryland\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"ryla\", \"Maryland\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"Marly\", \"Maryland\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"dany\", \"Maryland\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSince `\"land\"` and `\"ryla\"` are sub-strings of `\"Maryland\"`, `grepl()` returns `TRUE`, however when a regular expression like `\"Marly\"` or `\"dany\"` is searched `grepl()` returns `FALSE` because neither are sub-strings of `\"Maryland\"`.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Introduce the US states dataset `state.name`\n\nThere is a dataset that comes with R called `state.name` which is a vector of strings, one for each state in the United States of America.\n\nWe are going to use this vector in several of the following examples.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(state.name)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Alabama\"    \"Alaska\"     \"Arizona\"    \"Arkansas\"   \"California\"\n[6] \"Colorado\"  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlength(state.name)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 50\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nNext, we will build a **regular expression for identifying several strings in this vector** of character strings, specifically a regular expression that will match names of states that both start and end with a vowel.\n\nThe state name could start and end with any vowel, so we will not be able to match exact sub-strings like in the previous examples. Thankfully we can use **metacharacters** to look for vowels and other parts of strings.\n\n## metacharacters\n\nThe first metacharacter that we will discuss is `\".\"`.\n\nThe metacharacter that only consists of a period **represents any character other than a new line** (we will discuss new lines soon).\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Example\n\nLet's take a look at some examples using the period regex:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\".\", \"Maryland\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\".\", \"*&2[0+,%<@#~|}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\".\", \"\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nAs you can see the **period metacharacter is very liberal**. \n\nThis metacharacter is **most useful when you do not care about a set of characters** in a regular expression.\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Example\n\nHere is another example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"a.b\", c(\"aaa\", \"aab\", \"abb\", \"acadb\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the case above, `grepl()` returns `TRUE` for all strings that contain an `a` followed by any other character followed by a `b`.\n\n:::\n\n## repetition\n\nYou can specify a regular expression that **contains a certain number of characters or metacharacters** using the **enumeration metacharacters** (or sometimes called **quantifiers**).\n\n-   `+`: indicates that **one or more of the preceding expression** should be present (or matches at least 1 time)\n-   `*`: indicates that **zero or more of the preceding expression** is present (or matches at least 0 times)\n-   `?`: indicates that **zero or 1 of the preceding expression is not present or present at most 1 time** (or matches between 0 and 1 times)\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Example\n\nLet's take a look at some examples using these metacharacters:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Does \"Maryland\" contain one or more of \"a\" ?\ngrepl(\"a+\", \"Maryland\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Does \"Maryland\" contain one or more of \"x\" ?\ngrepl(\"x+\", \"Maryland\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Does \"Maryland\" contain zero or more of \"x\" ?\ngrepl(\"x*\", \"Maryland\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nIf you want to do more than one character, you need to wrap it in `()`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Does \"Maryland\" contain zero or more of \"x\" ?\ngrepl(\"(xx)*\", \"Maryland\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n\n### Question\n\nLet's practice a few out together. Make the following regular expressions for the character string \"spooky halloween spooky halloween spooky\": \n\n1. Does \"zz\" appear 1 or more times? \n2. Does \"ee\" appear 1 or more times? \n3. Does \"oo\" appear 0 or more times?\n4. Does \"ii\" appear 0 or more times?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## try it out\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\nYou can also **specify exact numbers of expressions** using curly brackets `{}`.\n\n-   `{n}`: exactly n\n-   `{n,}`: n or more\n-   `{,m}`: at most m\n-   `{n,m}`: between n and m\n\nFor example `\"a{5}\"` specifies \"a exactly five times\", `\"a{2,5}\"` specifies \"a between 2 and 5 times,\" and `\"a{2,}\"` specifies \"a at least 2 times.\" Let's take a look at some examples:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Does \"Mississippi\" contain exactly 2 adjacent \"s\" ?\ngrepl(\"s{2}\", \"Mississippi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This is equivalent to the expression above:\ngrepl(\"ss\", \"Mississippi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Does \"Mississippi\" contain between 1 and 3 adjacent \"s\" ?\ngrepl(\"s{1,3}\", \"Mississippi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Does \"Mississippi\" contain between 2 and 3 adjacent \"i\" ?\ngrepl(\"i{2,3}\", \"Mississippi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Does \"Mississippi\" contain between 2 adjacent \"iss\" ?\ngrepl(\"(iss){2}\", \"Mississippi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Does \"Mississippi\" contain between 2 adjacent \"ss\" ?\ngrepl(\"(ss){2}\", \"Mississippi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Does \"Mississippi\" contain the pattern of an \"i\" followed by \n# 2 of any character, with that pattern repeated three times adjacently?\ngrepl(\"(i.{2}){3}\", \"Mississippi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n\n### Question\n\nLet's practice a few out together. Make the following regular expressions for the character string \"spookyspookyhalloweenspookyspookyhalloween\": \n\n1. Search for \"spooky\" exactly 2 times. What about 3 times?\n2. Search for \"spooky\" exactly 2 times followed by any character of length 9 (i.e. \"halloween\").\n3. Same search as above, but search for that twice in a row. \n4. Same search as above, but search for that three times in a row. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## try it out\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## capture group\n\nIn the examples above, I used parentheses `()` to create a **capturing group**. A capturing group allows you to use quantifiers on other regular expressions.\n\nIn the \"Mississippi\" example, I first created the regex `\"i.{2}\"` which matches `i` followed by any two characters (\"iss\" or \"ipp\"). Then, I used a capture group to wrap that regex, and to specify exactly three adjacent occurrences of that regex.\n\nYou can specify **sets of characters** (or character sets or character classes) with regular expressions, some of which come built in, but you can build your own **character sets** too.\n\nMore on character sets next.\n\n## character sets\n\nFirst, we will discuss the built in character sets:\n\n-   words (`\"\\\\w\"`) = Words specify any letter, digit, or a underscore.\n-   digits (`\"\\\\d\"`) = Digits specify the digits 0 through 9\n-   whitespace characters (`\"\\\\s\"`) = whitespace specifies line breaks, tabs, or spaces\n\nEach of these character sets have their own compliments:\n\n-   not words (`\"\\\\W\"`)\n-   not digits (`\"\\\\D\"`)\n-   not whitespace characters (`\"\\\\S\"`)\n\nEach specifies all of the characters not included in their corresponding character sets.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Interesting fact\n\nTechnically, you are using the a character set `\"\\d\"` or `\"\\s\"` (with only one black slash), but because you are using this character set in a string, you need the second `\\` to escape the string. So you will type `\"\\\\d\"` or `\"\\\\s\"`.\n\nSo for example, to include a literal single or double quote in a string you can use `\\` to \"escape\" the string and being able to include a single or double quote:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndouble_quote <- \"\\\"\" # or '\"'\ndouble_quote\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"\\\"\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsingle_quote <- '\\'' # or \"'\"Copy\nsingle_quote\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"'\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat means if you want to include a literal backslash, you will need to double it up: `\"\\\\\"`.\n:::\n\nIn fact, putting two backslashes before any punctuation mark that is also a metacharacter indicates that you are looking for the symbol and not the metacharacter meaning. For example `\"\\\\.\"` indicates you are trying to match a period in a string. Let's take a look at a few examples:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"\\\\+\", \"tragedy + time = humor\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"\\\\.\", \"https://publichealth.jhu.edu\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Beware\n\nThe printed representation of a string is not the same as string itself, because the printed representation shows the escapes. To see the raw contents of the string, use `writeLines()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(\"\\'\", \"\\\"\", \"\\\\\")\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"'\"  \"\\\"\" \"\\\\\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwriteLines(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n'\n\"\n\\\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are a handful of other special characters. The most common are \"\\n\", newline, and \"\\t\", tab, but you can see the complete list by requesting help on\": ?'\"', or ?\"'\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?\"'\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou will also sometimes see strings like \"\\u00b5\", this is a way of writing non-English characters that works on all platforms:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(\"\\\\t\", \"\\\\n\", \"\\u00b5\")\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"\\\\t\" \"\\\\n\" \"µ\"  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwriteLines(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\\t\n\\n\nµ\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nLet's take a look at a few examples of built in character sets: `\"\\w\"`, `\"\\d\"`, `\"\\s\"`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"\\\\w\", \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"\\\\d\", \"0123456789\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# \"\\n\" is the metacharacter for a new line\n# \"\\t\" is the metacharacter for a tab\ngrepl(\"\\\\s\", \"\\n\\t   \")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"\\\\d\", \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"\\\\D\", \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"\\\\w\", \"\\n\\t   \")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## brackets\n\nYou can also specify specific character sets using straight brackets `[]`. For example a character set of just the vowels would look like: `\"[aeiou]\"`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"[aeiou]\", \"rhythms\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can find the complement to a specific character by putting a carrot `^` after the first bracket. For example `\"[^aeiou]\"` matches all characters except the lowercase vowels.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"[^aeiou]\", \"rhythms\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## ranges\n\nYou can also specify ranges of characters using a hyphen `-` inside of the brackets. For example `\"[a-m]\"` matches all of the lowercase characters between `a` and `m`, while `\"[5-8]\"` matches any digit between 5 and 8 inclusive. Let's take a look at some examples using custom character sets:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"[a-m]\", \"xyz\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"[a-m]\", \"ABC\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"[a-mA-M]\", \"ABC\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## beginning and end\n\nThere are also metacharacters for matching the beginning and the end of a string which are `\"^\"` and `\"$\"` respectively. Let's take a look at a few examples:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"^a\", c(\"bab\", \"aab\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE  TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"b$\", c(\"bab\", \"aab\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"^[ab]*$\", c(\"bab\", \"aab\", \"abc\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## OR metacharacter\n\nThe last metacharacter we will discuss is the OR metacharacter (`\"|\"`). The OR metacharacter matches either the regex on the left or the regex on the right side of this character. A few examples:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"a|b\", c(\"abc\", \"bcd\", \"cde\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrepl(\"North|South\", c(\"South Dakota\", \"North Carolina\", \"West Virginia\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we have learned enough to create a regular expression that matches all state names that both begin and end with a vowel:\n\n1.
